This blog is powered by [hugo](https://gohugo.io), and the theme is [coder](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder).

I use [Spacemacs](https://spacemacs.org) and [org-mode](https://orgmode.org) to write post. Then use [ox-hugo](https://ox-hugo.scripter.co) to export org file to markdown. Finally [GitHub Action](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/) will build the blog automatically after I push commit to GitHub.
