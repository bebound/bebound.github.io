This blog is powered by [hugo](https://gohugo.io). I have used many themes, from [nuo](https://github.com/laozhu/hugo-nuo) to [coder](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder), then [congo](https://github.com/jpanther/congo), now I'm using [LoveIt](https://github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt).

I use [Spacemacs](https://spacemacs.org) and [org-mode](https://orgmode.org) to write post. Then use [ox-hugo](https://ox-hugo.scripter.co) to export org file to markdown. Finally [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) will build the blog automatically after I push commit to GitHub.
