I bought a Kindle Paperwhite 1 in 2013, when I still in the university. I like it very much and I've read many programming books with it. It still works fine after 10 years, but I want to tries the new model with larger screen and faster fresh speed. So I bought a used Kindle Paperwhite 5 signature version for only 620 Yuan (about $90) recently. Here is my review.

The Kindle Paperwhite 5 has a 6.8 inch screen with 300 PPI, the screen size and the PPI both increase comparing with the previous model. The Kindle Paperwhite 6 has a larger 7 inch screen, and a double RM(1G) than Paperwhite 5(512M). You can buy a 16G model for 850 Yuan (about $120). I think the overall experience is good enough for reading books, so I choose PKW5.

The signature edition has a 32G storage, wireless charging and auto adjust light sensor. I haven't used the wireless charging. I don't think it's necessary as the battery life is so long and I hardly need to charge it. The auto adjust light is not noticeable as well. For the storage, I think 8G is big enough if you don't read manga.

The biggist difference between PKW5 and PKW1 is response speed. The KPW5 is much faster when openning books or click UI buttons. The page turning speed is also significantly improved.

Overall, I'm satisfied with the new model. If you want to buy a Kindle, I recommend you buying the KPW5 or KPW6, as a larger screen is worthy.


## Kindle Jailbreak {#kindle-jailbreak}

If you want to read PDF on Kindle, KOReader is a must-have app. You can follow the [Kindle Modding](https://kindlemodding.org/) guide to jailbreak your Kindle and install KOReader.

There are some plugins I recommend:

1.  [Kindle FileBrowser](https://github.com/guo-yong-zhi/kindle-filebrowser): You can transfer books through wifi without using USB cable.
2.  [KOL](https://github.com/yparitcher/KUAL_Booklet/): Open KOReader from main UI.
3.  [Cover Setter](https://www.mobileread.com/forums//showpost.php?p=4539994&postcount=33): Set a better cover for KUAL/KOL/HOTFIX
