It was deleted successfully but come back again after 20 seconds. This drives me nuts.
I tried these methods, but none of them works.
Boot in safe mode, delete account. Delete record in ZACCOUNT table in ~/Library/Accounts/Accounts4.sqlite. Later, RedHatDude&amp;rsquo;s answer in this post gives me a clue, it looks like a iCloud sync problem. I trie to delete the account on my 3 MacBooks together.</description></item></channel></rss>
