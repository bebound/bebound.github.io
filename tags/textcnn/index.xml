Although some features is missing when compared with TensorFlow (For example, the early stop function, History to draw plot), its code style is more intuitive.
Torchtext is a NLP package which is also made by pytorch team. It provide a way to read text, processing and iterate the texts.
Google Colab is a Jupyter notebook environment host by Google, you can use free GPU and TPU to run your modal.</description></item></channel></rss>
