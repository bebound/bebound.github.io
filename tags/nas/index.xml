Although it has a slow WEB UI and slow restart, it still fits my needs as all of the applications I need are running in Docker.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recently, I want to move some files from my Mac to NAS to save space. I need a application behave like Dropbox, which can show all the files in the NAS and only download the files I need. I have tried the QSync, but it does not have thumbnails for cloud image and it does not have icons to show the file status. I also tried the &lt;a href="https://www.seafile.com/home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Seafile&lt;/a>, it&amp;rsquo;s a powerful application, which requires 4G RAM to run, and there is bug in the thumbnail. I used to have a Synology ARM NAS, the Synology Drive has all the features I need, so I want to run it on my QNAP NAS. After some research, I managed to run Synology and QNAP together on my NAS. Here is the guide.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>QNAP TS-453Dmini Review</title><link>https://fromkk.com/posts/qnap-ts-453bmini-review/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 00:17:00 +0800</pubDate><author>bebound@gmail.com (KK)</author><guid>https://fromkk.com/posts/qnap-ts-453bmini-review/</guid><description>&lt;p>My first NAS is Synology DS120j, which is ARM based entry level product. It&amp;rsquo;s okay to use it for downloading and backup, but not power enough for running docker and virtual machine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I bought this NAS last month, and I&amp;rsquo;m satisfied with it. Here are the advantages and disadvantages.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="advantages">Advantages&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>High performance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is equipped with J4125 quad-core 2.0 GHz processor, 8G RAM, two 2.5G Ports and 4 bays. Here is the &lt;a href="https://www.qnap.com/zh-cn/product/ts-453dmini/specs/hardware" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">spec&lt;/a>. Although J4125 is not the fastest CPU in 2022(the newer model coming with N5105), it is still able to run several docker containers together, and I can even run Synology and Windows 10 inside build-in &lt;code>Virtualization Station&lt;/code>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
