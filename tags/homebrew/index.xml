However, brew command works.
After doing some research, I found Java has been moved to homebrew/core. As I installed java by cask, now it&amp;rsquo;s not available and throw this error. Now I need to uninstall it from cask.
Finally I found this issue: brew cask upgrade fails with &amp;ldquo;No Cask with this name exists&amp;rdquo;.</description></item></channel></rss>
