As I said before, I'm working on a text classification project. I use =doc2vec= to convert text into vectors, then I use LPA to classify the vectors.

LPA is a simple, effective semi-supervised algorithm. It can use the density of unlabeled data to find a hyperplane to split the data.

Here are the main stop of the algorithm:

0. Let $ (x_1,y1)...(x_l,y_l)$ be labeled data, $Y_L = \{y_1...y_l\} $ are the class labels. Let $(x_{l+1},y_{l+u})$ be unlabeled data where $Y_U = \{y_{l+1}...y_{l+u}\}$ are unobserved, usually $l \ll u$. Let $X=\{x_1...x_{l+u}\}$ where $x_i\in R^D$. The problem is to estimate $Y_U$ for $X$ and $Y_L$.
1. Calculate the similarity of the data points. The most simple metric is Euclidean distance. Use a parameter $\sigma$ to control the weights.

$$w_{ij}= exp(-\frac{d^2_{ij}}{\sigma^2})=exp(-\frac{\sum^D_{d=1}{(x^d_i-x^d_j})^2}{\sigma^2})$$

Larger weight allow labels to travel through easier.

2. Define a $(l+u)*(l+u)$ probabilistic transition matrix $T$


$$T_{ij}=P(j \rightarrow i)=\frac{w_{ij}}{\sum^{l+u}_{k=1}w_{kj}}$$


$T_{ij}$ is the probability to jump from node $j$ to $i$. If there are $C$ classes, we can define a $(l+u)*C$ label matrix $Y$, to represent the probability of a label belong to class $c$. The initialization of unlabeled data points is not important.


3. Propagate $Y \leftarrow TY$
4. Row-normalize Y.
5. Reset labeled data's Y. Repeat 3 until Y converges.

In short, let the nearest label has larger weight, then calculate each label's new label, reset labeled data's label, repeat.

**** LSTM

The avoid the problem of vanishing gradient and exploding gradient in vanilla RNN, LSTM was published, which can remember information for longer periods of time.

Here is the structure of LSTM:

#+attr_html: :class image-size-s
[[file:/images/LSTM_LSTM.png]]

The calculate procedure are:

$$\begin{aligned}
f_t&=\sigma(W_f\cdot[h_{t-1},x_t]+b_f)\\
i_t&=\sigma(W_i\cdot[h_{t-1},x_t]+b_i)\\
o_t&=\sigma(W_o\cdot[h_{t-1},x_t]+b_o)\\
\tilde{C_t}&=tanh(W_C\cdot[h_{t-1},x_t]+b_C)\\
C_t&=f_t\ast C_{t-1}+i_t\ast \tilde{C_t}\\
h_t&=o_t \ast tanh(C_t)
\end{aligned}$$

$f_t$,$i_t$,$o_t$ are forget gate, input gate and output gate respectively. $\tilde{C_t}$ is the new memory content. $C_t$ is cell state. $h_t$ is the output. 

Use $f_t$ and $i_t$ to update $C_t$, use $o_t$ to decide which part of hidden state should be outputted.

**** GRU

#+attr_html: :class image-size-s
[[file:/images/LSTM_GRU.png]]

$$\begin{aligned}
z_t&=\sigma(W_z\cdot[h_{t-1},x_t])\\
r_t&=\sigma(W_r\cdot[h_{t-1},x_t])\\
\tilde{h_t}&=tanh(W\cdot[r_t \ast h_{t-1},x_t])\\
h_t&=(1-z_t)\ast h_{t-1}+z_t \ast \tilde{h_t}
\end{aligned}$$

$z_t$ is update gate, $r_t$ is reset gate, $\tilde{h_t}$ is candidate activation, $h_t$ is activation.

Compare with LSTM, GRU merge cell state and hidden state to one hidden state, and use $z_t$ to decide how to update the state rather than $f_t$ and $i_t$.

Generally, =word2vec= is a language model to predict the words probability based on the context. When build the model, it create word embedding for each word, and word embedding is widely used in many NLP tasks.

**** Models
***** CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words)

Use the context to predict the probability of current word. (In the picture, the word is encoded with one-hot encoding, $W_{V*N}$ is word embedding, and $W_{V*N}^{'}$, the output weight matrix in hidden layer, is same as $\hat{\upsilon}$ in following equations)
#+attr_html: :class image-size-s
[[file:/images/doc2vec_cbow.png]]

1. Context words' vectors are $\upsilon_{c-n} ... \upsilon_{c+m}$ ($m$ is the window size)
2. Context vector $\hat{\upsilon}=\frac{\upsilon_{c-m}+\upsilon_{c-m+1}+...+\upsilon_{c+m}}{2m}$
3. Score vector $z_i = u_i\hat{\upsilon}$, where $u_i$ is the output vector representation of word $\omega_i$
4. Turn scores into probabilities $\hat{y}=softmax(z)$
5. We desire probabilities $\hat{y}$ match the true probabilities $y$.

We use cross entropy $H(\hat{y},y)$ to measure the distance between these two distributions.
$$H(\hat{y},y)=-\sum_{j=1}^{\lvert V \rvert}{y_j\log(\hat{y}_j)}$$

$y$ and $\hat{y}$ is accurate, so the loss simplifies to:
$$H(\hat{y},y)=-y_j\log(\hat{y})$$

For perfect prediction, $H(\hat{y},y)=-1\log(1)=0$

According to this, we can create this loss function:

$$\begin{aligned}
minimize\ J &=-\log P(\omega_c\lvert \omega_{c-m},...,\omega_{c-1},...,\omega_{c+m}) \\
&= -\log P(u_c \lvert \hat{\upsilon}) \\
&= -\log \frac{\exp(u_c^T\hat{\upsilon})}{\sum_{j=1}^{\lvert V \rvert}\exp (u_j^T\hat{\upsilon})} \\
&= -u_c^T\hat{\upsilon}+\log \sum_{j=1}^{\lvert V \rvert}\exp (u_j^T\hat{\upsilon})
\end{aligned}$$

***** Skip-Gram

Use current word to predict its context.

#+attr_html: :class image-size-s
[[file:/images/doc2vec_skip-gram.png]]


1. We get the input word's vector $\upsilon_c$
2. Generate $2m$ score vectors, $u_{c-m},...,u_{c-1},...,u_{c+m}$.
3. Turn scores into probabilities $\hat{y}=softmax(u)$
4. We desire probabilities $\hat{y}$ match the true probabilities $y$.

$$\begin{aligned}
minimize J &=-\log P(\omega_{c-m},...,\omega_{c-1},\omega_{c+1},...\omega_{c+m}\lvert \omega_c)\\
&=-\log \prod_{j=0,j\ne m}^{2m}P(\omega_{c-m+j}\lvert \omega_c)\\
&=-\log \prod_{j=0,j\ne m}^{2m}P(u_{c-m+j}\lvert \upsilon_c)\\
&=-\log \prod_{j=0,j\ne m}^{2m}\frac{\exp (u^T_{c-m+j}\upsilon_c)}{\sum_{k=1}^{\lvert V \rvert}{\exp (u^T_k \upsilon_c)}}\\
&=-\sum_{j=0,j\ne m}^{2m}{u^T_{c-m+j}\upsilon_c+2m\log \sum_{k=1}^{\lvert V \rvert} \exp(u^T_k \upsilon_c)}
\end{aligned}$$

**** Architectures

Minimize $J$ is expensive, you need to calculate the probability of each word in vocabulary list. There are two ways to reduce the computation. Hierarchical Softmax and Negative Sampling.

***** Hierarchical Softmax

Encode words into a huffman tree, then each word has a Huffman code. The probability of it's probability $P(w\lvert Context(\omega))$ can change to choose the path from root to the leaf node, each node is a binary classification. Suppose code $0$ is a positive label, $1$ is negative label. If the probability of a positive classification is 
$$\sigma(X^T_\omega \theta)=\frac{1}{1+e^{-X^T_\omega}}$$

Then the probability of negative classification is
$$1-\sigma(X^T_\omega \theta)$$

#+attr_html: :class image-size-s
[[file:/images/doc2vec_hierarchical_softmax.png]]

=足球='s Huffman code is $1001$, then it's probability in each node are

$$\begin{aligned}
p(d_2^\omega\lvert X_\omega,\theta^\omega_1&=1-\sigma(X^T_\omega \theta^\omega_1))\\
p(d^\omega_3\lvert X_\omega,\theta^\omega_2&=\sigma(X^T_\omega \theta^\omega_2))\\
p(d^\omega_4\lvert X_\omega,\theta^\omega_3&=\sigma(X^T_\omega \theta^\omega_3))\\
p(d^\omega_5\lvert X_\omega,\theta^\omega_4&=1-\sigma(X^T_\omega \theta^\omega_4))\\
\end{aligned}$$

where $\theta$ is parameter in the node.

The probability of the =足球= is the production of these equation.

Generally,

$$p(\omega\lvert Context(\omega))=\prod_{j=2}^{l\omega}p(d^\omega_j\lvert X_\omega,\theta^\omega_{j-1})$$

This reduce the calculation complexity to $log(n)$ instead of $n$

***** Negative Sampling

This method will choose some negative sample, then add the probability of the negative word into loss function. The optimisation target becomes maximise the positive words' probability and minimise the negative words' probability.

Let $P(D=0 \lvert \omega,c)$ be the probability that $(\omega,c)$ did not come from the corpus data. Then the objective function will be

$$\theta = \text{argmax} \prod_{(\omega,c)\in D} P(D=1\lvert \omega,c,\theta) \prod_{(\omega,c)\in \tilde{D}} P(D=0\lvert \omega,c,\theta)$$

where $\theta$ is the parameters of the model($\upsilon$ and $u$).

Here are some parameter in =gensim='s =doc2vec= class.
***** window
window is the maximum distance between the predicted word and context words used for prediction within a document. It will look behind and ahead.

In =skip-gram= model, if the window size is 2, the training samples will be this:(the blue word is the input word)

#+attr_html: :class image-size-s
[[file:/images/doc2vec_window.png]]

***** min_count
If the word appears less than this value, it will be skipped

***** sample
High frequency word like =the= is useless for training. =sample= is a threshold for deleting these higher-frequency words. The probability of keeping the word $w_i$ is:

$$P(w_i) = (\sqrt{\frac{z(\omega_i)}{s}} + 1) \cdot \frac{s}{z(\omega_i)}$$

where $z(w_i)$ is the frequency of the word and $s$ is the sample rate.

This is the plot when =sample= is 1e-3.

#+attr_html: :class image-size-s
[[file:/images/doc2vec_negative_sample.png]]

***** negative
Usually, when training a neural network, for each training sample, all of the weights in the neural network need to be tweaked. For example, if the word pair is ('fox', 'quick'), then only the word quick's neurons should output 1, and all of the other word neurons should output 0.

But it would takes a lot of time to do this when we have billions of training samples. So, instead of update all of the weight, we random choose a small number of "negative" words (default value is 5) to update the weight.(Update their wight to output 0).

So when dealing with word pair ('fox','quick'), we update quick's weight to output 1, and other 5 random words' weight to output 1.

The probability of selecting word $\omega_i$ is $P(\omega_i)$:

$$P(\omega_i)=\frac{{f(\omega_i)}^{{3}/{4}}}{\sum_{j=0}^{n}\left({f(\omega_j)}^{{3}/{4}}\right)}$$


$f(\omega_j)$ is the frequency of word $\omega_j$.

Here is a simple way to classify text without much human effort and get a impressive performance.

It can be divided into two steps:

1. Get train data by using keyword classification
2. Generate a more accurate classification model by using doc2vec and label spreading

***** Keyword-based Classification
Keyword based classification is a simple but effective method. Extracting the target keyword is a monotonous work. I use this method to automatic extract keyword candidate.


1. Find some most common words to classify the text.
2. Use this equation to calculate the score of each word appears in the text.
   $$ score(i) = \frac{count(i)}{all\_count(i)^{0.3}}$$
   where $all\_count(i)$ is the word $i$'s word count in all corpus, and $count(i)$ is the word $i$'s word count in positive corpus.
3. Check the top words, add it to the final keyword list. Repeat this process.

Finally, we can use the keywords to classify the text and get the train data. 

***** Classification by doc2vec and Label Spreading
Keyword-based classification sometimes produces the wrong result, as it can't using the semantic information in the text. Fortunately, Google has open sourced =word2vec=, which can be used to produce semantically meaningful word embeddings. Furthermore, sentences can also be converted to vectors by using =doc2vec=. Sentences which has closed meaning also have short vector distance.

So the problem is how to classify these vectors.

1. Using corpus to train the =doc2vec= model.
2. Using =doc2vec= model to convert sentence into vector.
3. Using label spreading algorithm to train a classify model to classify the vectors.

[[https://pytorch.org][PyTorch]] is a really powerful framework to build the machine learning models. Although some features is missing when compared with TensorFlow (For example, the early stop function, History to draw plot), its code style is more intuitive. 

[[https://github.com/pytorch/text][Torchtext]] is a NLP package which is also made by =pytorch= team. It provide a way to read text, processing and iterate the texts.

[[https://colab.research.google.com][Google Colab]] is a Jupyter notebook environment host by Google, you can use free GPU and TPU to run your modal.

Here is a simple tutorial to build a TextCNN modal and run it on Colab.

The [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5882][TextCNN paper]] was published by Kim in 2014. The model's idea is pretty simple, but the performance is impressive. If you trying to solve the text classification problem, this model is a good choice to start with.

The main architecture is shown below:

#+attr_html: :class image-size-s
[[file:/images/textcnn.png]]

It uses different kernels to extract text features, then use the softmax regression to classify text base on the features.

Now we can build this model step by step.

First build the model. The model I use is CNN-multichannel, which contains two sets of word embedding. Both of them is the copy of word embedding generate from corpus, but only one set will update embedding during training.

The code is below:
#+BEGIN_SRC python
  class textCNNMulti(nn.Module):
      def __init__(self,args):
          super().__init__()
          dim = args['dim']
          n_class = args['n_class']
          embedding_matrix=args['embedding_matrix']
          kernels=[3,4,5]
          kernel_number=[150,150,150]
          self.static_embed = nn.Embedding.from_pretrained(embedding_matrix)
          self.non_static_embed = nn.Embedding.from_pretrained(embedding_matrix, freeze=False)
          self.convs = nn.ModuleList([nn.Conv2d(2, number, (size, dim),padding=(size-1,0)) for (size,number) in zip(kernels,kernel_number)])
          self.dropout=nn.Dropout()
          self.out = nn.Linear(sum(kernel_number), n_class)

      def forward(self, x):
          non_static_input = self.non_static_embed(x)
          static_input = self.static_embed(x)
          x = torch.stack([non_static_input, static_input], dim=1)
          x = [F.relu(conv(x)).squeeze(3) for conv in self.convs]
          x = [F.max_pool1d(i, i.size(2)).squeeze(2) for i in x]
          x = torch.cat(x, 1)
          x = self.dropout(x)
          x = self.out(x)
          return x
#+END_SRC

Second, convert text into word index, so each sentence become a vector for training.

#+BEGIN_SRC python

  TEXT = data.Field(lower=True,batch_first=True)
  LABEL = data.LabelField()

  train, val, test = datasets.SST.splits(TEXT, LABEL, 'data/',fine_grained=True)

  TEXT.build_vocab(train, vectors="glove.840B.300d")
  LABEL.build_vocab(train,val,test)

  train_iter, val_iter, test_iter = data.BucketIterator.splits(
      (train, val, test), batch_sizes=(128, 256, 256),shuffle=True)

#+END_SRC

=Field= defines how to process text, here is the most common parameters:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
sequential – Whether the datatype represents sequential data. If False, no tokenization is applied. Default: True.

use_vocab – Whether to use a Vocab object. If False, the data in this field should already be numerical. Default: True.

preprocessing – The Pipeline that will be applied to examples using this field after tokenizing but before numericalizing. Many Datasets replace this attribute with a custom preprocessor. Default: None.

batch_first – Whether to produce tensors with the batch dimension first. Default: False.
#+END_QUOTE

=datasets.SST.splits= will load the =SST= datasets, and split into train, validation, and test Dataset objects.

~build_vocab~ will create the Vocab object for Field, which contains the information to convert word into word index and vice versa. Also, the word embedding will save as ~Field.Vocab.vectors~. =vectors= contains all of the word embedding. Torchtext can download some pretrained vectors automatically, such as =glove.840B.300d=, =fasttext.en.300d=. You can also load your vectors in this way, =xxx.vec= should be the standard word2vec format.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
from torchtext.vocab import Vectors

vectors = Vectors(name='xxx.vec', cache='./')
TEXT.build_vocab(train, val, test, vectors=vectors)
#+END_SRC

~data.BucketIterator.splits~ will returns iterators that loads batches of data from datasets, and the text in same batch has similar lengths.


Now, we can start to train the model. First we wrap some parameters into =args=, it contains settings like output class, learning rate, log interval and so on.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
args={}
args['vocb_size']=len(TEXT.vocab)
args['dim']=300
args['n_class']=len(LABEL.vocab)
args['embedding_matrix']=TEXT.vocab.vectors
args['lr']=0.001
args['momentum']=0.8
args['epochs']=180
args['log_interval']=100
args['test_interval']=500
args['save_dir']='./'
#+END_SRC


Finally, we can train the model.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  model=textCNNMulti(args)
  model.cuda()
  optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=args['lr'],momentum=args['momentum'])
  criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
  steps=0
  for epoch in range(1, args['epochs']+1):
      for i,data in enumerate(train_iter):
          steps+=1

          x, target = data.text, data.label
          x=x.cuda()

          target.sub_(1)
          target=target.cuda()

          output = model(x)
          loss = criterion(output, target)
          optimizer.zero_grad()
          loss.backward()
          optimizer.step()
#+END_SRC

PyTorch provide a simple DQN implementation to solve the cartpole game. However, the code is incorrect, it diverges after training (It has been discussed [[https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/dqn-example-from-pytorch-diverged/4123][here]]).

The official code's training data is below, it's high score is about 50 and finally diverges.

#+attr_html: :class image-size-s
[[file:/images/ddqn_official.png]]

There are many reason that lead to divergence.

First it use the difference of two frame as input in the tutorial, not only it loss the cart's absolute information(This information is useful, as game will terminate if cart moves too far from centre), but also confused the agent when difference is the same but the state is varied.

Second, small replay memory. If the memory is too small, the agent will forget the strategy it has token in some state. I'm not sure whether =10000= memory is big enough, but I suggest using a higher value.

Third, the parameters. =learning_rate=, =target_update_interval= may cause fluctuation. Here is a example on [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49837204/performance-fluctuates-as-it-is-trained-with-dqn][Stack Overflow]]. I also met this problem when training cartpole agent. The reward stops growing after 1000 episode.

#+attr_html: :class image-size-s

After doing some research on the cartpole DNQ code, I managed to made a model to play the flappy bird. Here are the changes from the original cartpole code. Most of the technology can be found in these two papers: [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602][Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning]] and [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02298][Rainbow: Combining Improvements in Deep Reinforcement Learning]].

Here is the model architecture:

Here is a trained result:

1. Dueling DQN
   
   The vanilla DQN has the overestimate problem. As the =max= function will accumulate the noise when training. This leads to converging at suboptimal point. Two following architectures are submitted to solve this problem. 
   
   $$ Q(s, a) = r + \gamma \max_{a'}[Q(s', a')] $$

   Double DQN was published two year later DQN. It has two value function, one is used to choose the action with max Q value, another one is used to calculate the Q value of this action.

   $$ a^{max}(S'_j, w) = \arg\max_{a'}Q(\phi(S'_j),a,w) $$

   $$ Q(s,a) = r + \gamma Q'(\phi(S'_j),a^{max}(S'_j, w),w') $$

   Dueling DQN is another solution. It has two estimator, one estimates the score of current state, another estimates the action score. 

   $$Q(s, a) = r + \gamma( \max_{a’}[A(s',a')+V(s')]$$

   In order to distinguish the score of the actions, the return the Q-value will minus the mean action score:

   In this project, I use dueling DQN.

2. Image processing

   I grayscale and crop the image.

3. Stack frames
   
   I use the last 4 frame as the input. This should help the agent to know the change of environment.

4. Extra FC before last layer
   
   I add a FC between the image features and the FC for calculate Q-Value.

5. Frame Skipping
   
   Frame-skipping means agent sees and selects actions on every k frame instead of every frame, the last action is repeated on skipped frames. This method will accelerate the training procedure. In this project, I use =frame_skipping=2=, as the more the frame skipping is, the more the bird is likely to hit the pipe. And this method did help the agent to converge faster. More details can be found in this [[https://danieltakeshi.github.io/2016/11/25/frame-skipping-and-preprocessing-for-deep-q-networks-on-atari-2600-games/][post]].

6. Prioritized Experience Replay
   
   This idea was published [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05952][here]]. It's a very simple idea: replay high TD error experience more frequently. My code implementation is not efficient. But in cartpole game, this technology help the agent converge faster. 

7. Colab and Kaggle Kernel
   
   My MacBook doesn't support CUDA, so I use these two website to train the model. Here are the comparison of them. During training, Kaggle seems more stable, Colab usually disconnected after 1h.

  |                      | Colab         | Kaggle Kernel   |
  | GPU                  | Tesla T4(16G) | Tesla P100(16G) |
  | RAM                  | 13G           | 13G             |
  | Max training time    | 12h           | 9h              |
  | Export trained model | Google Drive  | -               |

The lesson I learnt from this project is patience. It takes a long time(maybe hundreds of thousand steps) to see whether this model works, and there are so many parameters can effect the final performance. It takes me about 3 weeks to build the final model. So if you want to build your own model, be patient and good luck. Here are two articles talking about the debugging and hyperparameter tuning in DQN:
- [[https://adgefficiency.com/dqn-debugging/][DQN debugging using Open AI gym Cartpole]]
- [[https://adgefficiency.com/dqn-tuning/][DDQN hyperparameter tuning using Open AI gym Cartpole]]

 
  Here are something may help with this task.
- [[https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/summaries_and_tensorboard][TensorBoard]]

  It's a visualization tool made by TensorFlow Team. It's more convenient to use it rather than generate graph manually by matplotlib. Besides =reward= and =mean_q=, these variable are also useful when debugging: TD-error, loss and action_distribution, avg_priority.
  
- Advanced image pre-processing

  In this project, I just grayscalize the image. A more advance technology such as binarize should help agent to filter unimportant detail of game output.

$s_t$ and $h_i$ are source hidden states and target hidden state, the shape is =(n,1)=. $c_t$ is the final context vector, and $\alpha_{t,s}$ is alignment score.

**** Global(Soft) VS Local(Hard)

Global Attention takes all source hidden states into account, and local attention only use part of the source hidden states.

**** Content-based VS Location-based

Content-based Attention uses both source hidden states and target hidden states, but location-based attention only use source hidden states.

Here are several popular attention mechanisms:


****** Dot-Product
$$score(s_t,h_i)=s_t^Th_i$$

****** Scaled Dot-Product
$$score(s_t,h_i)=\frac{s_t^Th_i}{\sqrt{n}}$$
where n is the vectors dimension. Google's Transformer model has similar scaling factor when calculate self-attention: $score=\frac{KQ^T}{\sqrt{n}}$

****** Location-Base

$$socre(s_t,h_i)=softmax(W_as_t)$$

****** General

$$score(s_t,h_i)=s_t^TW_ah_i$$

$Wa$'s shape is =(n,n)=

****** Concat

$$score(s_t,h_i)=v_a^Ttanh(W_a[s_t,h_i])$$

$v_a$'s shape is =(x,1)=, and $Wa$ 's shape is =(x,x)=. This is similar to a neural network with one hidden layer.


When I doing a slot filling project, I compare these mechanisms. *Concat* attention produce the best result.

   :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: the-annotated-the-annotated-transformer
   :END:
Thanks for the articles I list at the end of this post, I understand how transformers works. These posts are comprehensive, but there are some points that confused me.

First, this is the graph that was referenced by almost all of the post related to Transformer.

#+attr_html: :class image-size-s
[[file:/images/transformer_main.png]]

Transformer consists of these parts: Input, Encoder*N, Output Input, Decoder*N, Output. I'll explain them step by step.

**** Input

The input word will map to 512 dimension vector. Then generate Positional Encoding(PE) and add it to the original embeddings.



***** Positional Encoding

The transformer model does not contains recurrence and convolution. In order to let the model capture the sequence of input word, it add PE into embeddings.

#+attr_html: :width 500
[[file:/images/transformer_add_pe.png]]


PE will generate a 512 dimension vector for each position:

$$\begin{align*}
    PE_{(pos,2i)} = sin(pos / 10000^{2i/d_{model}}) \\
    PE_{(pos,2i+1)} = cos(pos / 10000^{2i/d_{model}})
\end{align*}$$
The even and odd dimension use =sin= and =cos= function respectively.

For example, the second word's PE should be: $sin(2 / 10000^{0 / 512}), cos(2 / 10000^{0 / 512}), sin(2 / 10000^{2 / 512}), cos(2 / 10000^{2 / 512})\text{...}$

The value range of PE is =(-1,1)=, and each position's PE is slight different, as =cos= and =sin= has different frequency. Also, for any fixed offset k, $PE_{pos+k}$ can be represented as a linear function of $PE_{pos}$.

For even dimension, let $10000^{2i/d_{model}}$ be $\alpha$, for even dimension:

$$\begin{aligned}
PE_{pos+k}&=sin((pos+k)/\alpha) \\
&=sin(pos/\alpha)cos(k/\alpha)+cos(pos/\alpha)sin(k/\alpha)\\
&=PE_{pos\_even}K_1+PE_{pos\_odd}K_2
\end{aligned}$$

#+attr_html: :width 500
[[file:/images/transformer_pe1.png]]

The PE implementation in [[https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor/blob/5bfe69a7d68b7d61d51fac36c6088f94b9d6fdc6/tensor2tensor/layers/common_attention.py#L457][tensor2tensor]] use =sin= in first half of dimension and =cos= in the rest part of dimension.
#+attr_html: :width 500
[[file:/images/transformer_pe2.png]]


**** Encoder

There are 6 Encoder layer in Transformer, each layer consists of two sub-layer: Multi-Head Attention and Feed Forward Neural Network.

***** Multi-Head Attention

Let's begin with single head attention. In short, it maps word embeddings to =q= =k= =v= and use =q= =k= =v= vector to calculate the attention.

The input words map to =q= =k= =v= by multiply the Query, Keys Values matrix. Then for the given Query, the attention for each word in sentence will be calculated by this formula: $\mathrm{attention}=\mathrm{softmax}(\frac{qk^T}{\sqrt{d_k}})v$, where =q= =k= =v= is a 64 dimension vector.
#+attr_html: :width 500
[[file:/images/transformer_self_attention.png]]


Matrix view:

$Attention(Q, K, V) = \mathrm{softmax}(\frac{(XW^Q)(XW^K)^T}{\sqrt{d_k}})(XW^V)$ where $X$ is the input embedding.

The single head attention only output a 64 dimension vector, but the input dimension is 512. How to transform back to 512? That's why transformer has multi-head attention.

Each head has its own $W^Q$ $W^K$ $W^V$ matrix, and produces $Z_0,Z_1...Z_7$,($Z_0$'s shape is =(512, 64)=) the concat the outputted vectors as $O$. $O$ will multiply a weight matrix $W^O$ ($W^O$'s shape is =(512, 512)=) and the result is $Z$, which will be sent to Feed Forward Network.

#+attr_html: :width 500
[[file:/images/transformer_multihead.png]]

Multi-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions.

The whole procedure looks like this:

#+attr_html: :width 500
[[file:/images/transformer_multihead_all.png]]

***** Add & Norm

This layer works like this line of code: =norm(x+dropout(sublayer(x)))= or =x+dropout(sublayer(norm(x)))=. The sublayer is Multi-Head Attention or FF Network.

****** Layer Normalization

Layer Norm is similar to Batch Normalization, but it tries to normalize the whole layer's features rather than each feature.(*Scale* and *Shift* also apply for each feature) More details can be found in this [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06450][paper]].

#+attr_html: :width 500
[[file:/images/transformer_layer_norm.png]]

***** Position-wise Feed Forward Network

This layer is a Neural Network whose size is =(512, 2048, 512)=. The exact same feed-forward network is independently applied to each position.

#+attr_html: :width 500
[[file:/images/transformer_encoder.png]]

**** Output Input

Same as Input.

**** Decoder

The decoder is pretty similar to Encoder. It also has 6 layers, but has 3 sublayers in each Decoder. It add a masked multi-head-attention at the beginning of Decoder.

***** Masked Multi-Head Attention

This layer is used to block future words during training. For example, if the output is =<bos> hello world <eos>=. First, we should use =<bos>= as input to predict =hello=, =hello world <eos>= will be masked to 0.

***** Key and Value in Decoder Multi-Head Attention Layer

In Encoder, the =q= =k= =v= vector is generated by $XW^Q$, $XW^K$ and $XW^V$. In the second sub-layer of Decoder, =q= =k= =v= was generated by $XW^Q$, $YW^K$ and $YW^V$, where $Y$ is the Encoder's output, $X$ is the =<init of sentence>= or previous output.

The animation below illustrates how to apply the Transformer to machine translation.

#+attr_html: :width 500
[[file:/images/transformer_translate.gif]]

**** Output

Using a linear layer to predict the output.

*** DONE Near-duplicate with SimHash                              :SimHash:
CLOSED: [2019-12-04 Wed 00:16]
   :PROPERTIES:
   :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: near-duplicate-with-simhash
   :END:
Before talking about *SimHash*, let's review some other methods which can also identify duplication.


**** Longest Common Subsequence(LCS)
This is the algorithm used by =diff= command. It is also *edit distance* with insertion and deletion as the only two edit operations.

This works good for short strings. However, the algorithm's time complexity is $O(m*n)$, if two strings' lengths are $m$ and $n$ respectively. So it's not suitable for large corpus. Also, if two corpus consists of same paragraph but the order is not same. LCS treat them as different corpus, and that's not we expected.

**** Bag of Words(BoW)

Transform document into the words it contains, then using Jaccard Similarity to calculate the similarity.

For example, if document A contains ={a,b,c}= and B contains ={a,b,d}=, then $$Similarity = \frac{A \cap B}{A \cap B} = \frac{\{a,b\}}{\{a,b,c,d\}}=\frac{1}{2}$$

**** Shingling (n-gram)

BoW drops the word context information. In order to take word context into consideration, we convert sentences into phrases. For instance, =roses are red and violets are blue= will convert to =roses are red=, =are red and=, =red and voilets= ...

**** Hashing

Saving shingling result take k times disk space if using k words phrase. To solve this problem, save phrase's hashing value instead of string.

#+attr_html: :width 600
[[file:/images/simhash_hashing.png]]

**** MinHash

The larger the document is, the more the hashing needs to compare. Is there a way to map documents to constant value? *MinHash* tackles this problem.

It uses $k$ hashing functions to calculate the phrase hashes. Then for each hashing function, using the minimal hashing result as signature. Finally, we get $k$ hashing value as document's signature. The procedure is shown below.


#+attr_html: :width 600
[[file:/images/simhash_minhash1.png]]

#+attr_html: :width 600
[[file:/images/simhash_minhash2.png]]

Compare with Hashing, *MinHash* successfully reduce the time complexity and storage complexity to $O(1)$, an improvement over $O(m+n)$ and $O(n)$, where n is the phrase number, m is the phrase number to compare.

**** SimHash 

For a given document, how to find it's most similar document? If using *MinHash*, we need to travel the whole corpus. Is there any more effective method? *SimHash* comes to the rescue.

For a set of input hashes, *SimHash* will generate a fingerprint(f-bits vector) for the input And the produced hashes has a property: similar input hashes generate similar fingerprint. So the dissimilarity of two documents can be calculated by the =XOR= of two fingerprint. In google's [[https://www2007.org/papers/paper215.pdf][Detecting Near-Duplicates for Web Crawling]] paper, they map 8B web-pages to 64 bits. If two bits differ less than *3* bits, then two web-pages are similar.

The calculation of *SimHash* is quiet simple. Given a set of features extracted from the document and their weights, we'll maintain f-bits vector $V$, and initialize it to zero. Each feature will also hash to f-bit value $V_i$. Then each dimension of $V_i$ will multiply by it's weight $W_i$ and add this new value to $V$. If i-th bits if 1, then $V$ is incremented by the weight of that feature. Otherwise $V$ is decremented by the weight. When all features have been processed, $V$ contains positive and negative dimension. Mapping positive values to =1= and negative numbers to =0= to get the final hash value.

$$V = zero\_or\_one(\sum{W_i*inc\_or\_dec(V_i)})$$

***** How to generate features from document

One easy way to do this is to use a window to get sub-string from document. For each sub-string, using the hash value of string as features, and the count of this string as weight.

For example, if we has this sentence: =kk really rocks!=.

First, pre-processing this sentence to =kkreallyrocks=.

Then using a window of 4 to generate sub-string from the sentence. We'll get the sub-string and their count: =(kkre, 1), (krea, 1)=, =(real, 1)= etc.

Suppose we only get these first 3 sub-string and their hash values are =1001=, =0101= and =1101= respectively. Then the final $V$ should be =1101=

#+attr_html: :width 500
[[file:/images/simhash.png]]
***** How to find similar document

Iterating over all document and compare with target simhash value is a time consuming operation. Is there any smart way to accomplish this task? In Google's paper, they published a very neat algorithm.

If the hash value is a 64-bit vector, and we want to find the document which is 2-bit differs with the target. Then we can divided the vector to 4 part: $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$. Then we know that at least two part should be the identical.

Suppose part $A$ and $B$ is identical, if we have sorted the hash by $ABCD$ order, we can easily find all hash that $AB$ part is identical. Then we can compare the rest part $B$ and $C$ and find hash vectors that differs from target at most 2 bit. If you have 8B($2^{34}$) document and documents are distributed uniformly at random, on average, you only need to compare $2^{34-32}=4$ fingerprints.

[[file:/images/simhash_query1.png]]

Besides $AB$, $AC$, $AD$, $BC$, $BD$ and $CD$ may also be identical. So you need to keep $C_4^2=6$ sorted list, and compare 4 fingerprints in each list. You don't need to compare 8B documents anymore, that's a great improvement.

[[file:/images/simhash_query2.png]]

Depending on the fingerprints' bit and documents number, you need to find a optimal number to split the hash value.

The above result is based on =http= protocol. A very interesting result is that, =bolt= protocol will decrease the time of the first method, but double the time of second method.

CLOSED: [2018-11-03 Sun 21:20]
   :PROPERTIES:
   :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: deploy-nikola-org-mode-on-travis
   :END:
Recently, I enjoy using =Spacemacs=, so I decided to switch to org file from Markdown for writing blog. After several attempts, I managed to let Travis convert org file to HTML. Here are the steps.
**** Install Org Mode plugin
First you need to install Org Mode plugin on your computer following the official guide: [[https://plugins.getnikola.com/v8/orgmode/][Nikola orgmode plugin]].
**** Edit =conf.el=
=Org Mode= will convert to HTML to display on Nikola. Org Mode plugin will call Emacs to do this job. When I run =nikola build=, it shows this message: =Please install htmlize from https://github.com/hniksic/emacs-htmlize=. I'm using =Spacemacs=, the =htmlize= package is already downloaded if the =org= layer is enabled. I just need to add htmlize folder to load-path. So here is the code:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq dir "~/.emacs.d/elpa/27.0/develop/")
(if(file-directory-p dir)
    (let ((default-directory dir))
      (normal-top-level-add-subdirs-to-load-path)))
(require 'htmlize)
#+END_SRC

This package is also needed on Travis, the similar approach is required.

**** Modify =.travis.yml=
Travis is using ubuntu 14.04, and the default Emacs version is 24, and the Org Mode version is below 8.0, which not match the requirements. The easiest solution is to update Emacs to 25. So in the =before_install= section, add these code:
#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
- sudo add-apt-repository ppa:kelleyk/emacs -y
- sudo apt-get update
#+END_SRC
In the =install= section, add these code:
#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
- sudo apt-get remove emacs
- sudo apt autoremove
- sudo apt-get install emacs25
#+END_SRC

The default emacs doesn't contains =htmlize= package. So add =git clone https://github.com/hniksic/emacs-htmlize ~/emacs-htmlize= into =before_install= section.

Finally, modify =conf.el= for Travis Emacs, add GitHub repo to =load-path=: ~(add-to-list 'load-path "~/emacs-htmlize/")~

Voila, the org file should show up.

The full =.travis.yml= is below:
#+BEGIN_SRC yaml

These days, I’m working on some text classification works, and I use =gensim= ’s =doc2vec= function.

When using gensim, it shows this warning message:


=C extension not loaded for Word2Vec, training will be slow.=

I search this on Internet and found that gensim has rewrite some part of the code using =cython= rather than =numpy= to get better performance. A compiler is required to enable this feature.

I tried to install mingw and add it into the path, but it's not working.

Finally, I tried to install [[https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2017][Visual C++ Build Tools]] and it works.

If this output is not =-1=, then it's fine.

   :PROPERTIES:
   :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: program-crash-caused-by-cpu-instruction
   :END:
It's inevitable to dealing with bugs in coding career. The main part of coding are implementing new features, fixing bugs and improving performance. For me, there are two kinds of bugs that is difficult to tackle: those are hard to reproduce, and those occur in code not wrote by you.

Recently, I met a bug which has both features mentioned before. I write a Spark program to analyse the log and cluster them. Last week I update the code, use Facebook's [[https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss][faiss]] library to accelerate the process of find similar vector. After I push the new code to spark, the program crashed. I found this log on Spark driver:

#+begin_src 
java.io.EOFException
ERROR PythonRunner: Python worker exited unexpectedly (crashed).
#+end_src

Because the Python Worker is created by Spark JVM, I can't get the internal state of Python Worker. By inserting log into Code, I get the rough position of crash code. But the code looks good.

I have tested the code on my develop environment. My develop machine is Using Spark 2.4. but the Spark platform is using Spark 3.0. I guess maybe there is some compatible problem on Spark 3.0. So I use the same docker images as Spark platform to run the code. The code works as expected without crash. That's wired, the docker has isolate the environment, how could same docker image produce different output?

I search the error from google, some said it's because spark is running out of memory. This doesn't seem correct, this update shouldn't increase the RAM usage. I still gave it a try and no luck.

Alright, this update add faiss to the code, maybe faiss lead to the crash, as Python doesn't raise any other. If the crash is caused by the C code in faiss, this makes sense. First, I write a code with spark and faiss, the program crashed. Then I wrote a code only contains faiss, it still crashed. So I can confirm that the crash is cause by faiss and Spark is innocent. Even stranger, when running on Spark platform, sometimes the script crashes, sometimes not.

But why faiss only crash on the Spark Platform? I ask the colleague to know the detail of the failed job and know that the docker's exit code is 132. =132= means illegal instruction. I search illegal instruction on faiss's GitHub issue. I found this issue: [[https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss/issues/426][Illegal instruction (core dumped)]].

By compare the host server's CPU instruction. The crashed ones lack of =avx2= instruction. =avx2= is added after the Intel Fourth generation core (Haswell). The develop server is using sixth generation CPU, and some platform server is too to support this instruction. By adding a parameter to enforce the script scheduling on new server, the crash disappears.

PS: Running faiss code =index.add(xx)= will not trigger the crash, but calling =faiss.search(xx)= does. When I trying to locate the code which cause the crash, the =faiss= package was imported correctly and the index is built normally. This mislead me to believe that faiss code is working.

*** DONE Difference between Value and Pointer variable in Defer in Go :Defer:Go:
CLOSED: [2019-12-19 Thu 22:33]
   :PROPERTIES:
   :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: difference-between-value-and-pointer-variable-in-defer-in-go
   :END:

=defer= is a useful function to do cleanup, as it will execute in LIFO order before the surrounding function returns. If you don't know how it works, sometimes the execution result may confuse you.

**** How it Works and Why Value or Pointer Receiver Matters

I found an interesting code on [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28893586/golang-defer-clarification][Stack Overflow]]:

#+begin_src go
type X struct {
    S string
}

func (x X) Close() {
    fmt.Println("Value-Closing", x.S)
}

func (x *X) CloseP() {
    fmt.Println("Pointer-Closing", x.S)
}

func main() {
    x := X{"Value-X First"}
    defer x.Close()
    x = X{"Value-X Second"}
    defer x.Close()

    x2 := X{"Value-X2 First"}
    defer x2.CloseP()
    x2 = X{"Value-X2 Second"}
    defer x2.CloseP()

    xp := &X{"Pointer-X First"}
    defer xp.Close()
    xp = &X{"Pointer-X Second"}
    defer xp.Close()

    xp2 := &X{"Pointer-X2 First"}
    defer xp2.CloseP()
    xp2 = &X{"Pointer-X2 Second"}
    defer xp2.CloseP()
}
#+end_src

The output is:

#+begin_src text -n
Pointer-Closing Pointer-X2 Second
Pointer-Closing Pointer-X2 First
Value-Closing Pointer-X Second
Value-Closing Pointer-X First
Pointer-Closing Value-X2 Second
Pointer-Closing Value-X2 Second
Value-Closing Value-X Second
Value-Closing Value-X First
#+end_src

Take a look at line 5-6, why =Pointer-Closing Value-X2 Second= was printed twice? According to [[https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#defer][Effective Go]], "*The arguments to the deferred function (which include the receiver if the function is a method) are evaluated when the defer executes, not when the call executes.*". And the function's parameters will *saved anew* when evaluated.

As =x2= is value and the defer function =CloseP='s receiver is a pointer, once =defer= executes, it will create a pointer which points to =x2= as function's caller. In the following defer, it will create a pointer which point to =x2= again. Although =x2.S= change to "Second", =x2='s address never changes. Finally, when these two defer is called, the same log was printed again.

**** How to Exit Program and Run all Defer

From [[https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/#Goexit][Golang Runtime]]:
#+begin_quote
~runtime.Goexit()~ terminates the goroutine that calls it. No other goroutine is affected. Goexit runs all deferred calls before terminating the goroutine. Because Goexit is not a panic, any recover calls in those deferred functions will return nil.

Calling Goexit from the main goroutine terminates that goroutine without func main returning. Since func main has not returned, the program continues execution of other goroutines. If all other goroutines exit, the program crashes.
#+end_quote

If you want the program to exit normally, just add ~defer os.Exit(0)~ at the top of =main= function. Here is the example code:
#+begin_src go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"runtime"
	"time"
)

func subGoroutine() {
	defer fmt.Println("exit sub routine")
	for {
		fmt.Println("sub goroutine running")
		time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
	}
}

func main() {
	defer os.Exit(0)
	defer fmt.Println("calling os.Exit")

	go subGoroutine()

	time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
	runtime.Goexit()
}
#+end_src

Output:
#+begin_src
sub goroutine running
sub goroutine running
sub goroutine running
calling os.Exit

Process finished with exit code 0
#+end_src

The defer code in main goroutine are executed, but those in =subGoroutine= will not be executed. As =os.Exit= will 

#+begin_quote
Exit causes the current program to exit with the given status code. Conventionally, code zero indicates success, non-zero an error. The program terminates immediately; deferred functions are not run.

CSRF(Cross-site request forgery) is a way to generate fake user request to target website. For example, on a malicious website A, there is a button, click it will send request to www.B.com/logout. When the user click this button, he will logout from website B unconsciously. Logout is not a big problem, but malicious website can generate more dangerous request like money transfer.

**** Django CSRF protection

Each web framework has different approach to do CSRF protection. In Django, the  validation process is below:

1. When user login for the first time, Django generate a =csrf_secret=, add random salt and encrypt it as A, save A to cookie =csrftoken=.
2. When Django processing tag ={{ csrf_token }}= or ={% csrf_token %}=, it read =csrftoken= cookie A, reverse it to =csrf_secret=, add random salt and encrypt it as B, return corresponding HTML.
3. When Django receive POST request, it will retrieve cookie =csrftoken= as A, and tries to get =csrfmiddlewaretoken= value B from POST data, if it does not exist, it will get header =X-CSRFToken= value as B. Then A and B will be reversed to =csrf_secret=. If the values are identical, the validation is passed. Otherwise, a 403 error will raise.

**** Django CSRF Usage

*** DONE Python Dictionary Implementation
CLOSED: [2019-02-17 Sun 21:48]
   :PROPERTIES:
   :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: python-dictionary-implementation
   :END:
**** Overview
1. CPython allocation memory to save dictionary, the initial table size is 8, entries are saved as =<hash,key,value>= in each slot(The slot content changed after Python 3.6).
2. When a new key is added, python use =i = hash(key) & mask= where =mask=table_size-1= to calculate which slot it should be placed. If the slot is occupied, CPython using a probing algorithm to find the empty slot to store new item.
3. When 2/3 of the table is full, the table will be resized.
4. When getting item from dictionary, both =hash= and =key= must be equal.

**** Resizing
When elements size is below 50000, the table size will increase by a factor of 4 based on used slots. Otherwise, it will increase by a factor of 2. The dictionary size is always $2^{n}$.

| dict size | resize when elements in dict | new table size |
|         8 |                            6 |             32 |
|        32 |                           22 |            128 |
|       128 |                           86 |            512 |


Removing item from dictionary doesn't lead to shrink table. The value of the item will marks as null but not empty. When looking up element in dictionary, it will keep probing once find this special mark. So deleting element from Python will not decrease the memory using. If you really want to do so, you can the items in the old dictionary to create a new one.
**** Probing
CPython used a modified *random probing* algorithm to choose the empty slot. This algorithm can traval all of the slots in a pseudo random order.

The travel order can be calculated by this formula: =j = ((5*j) + 1) mod 2**i=, where =j= is slot index.

For example, if table size is 8, and the calculate slot index is 2, then the traversal order should be:

=2 -> (5*2+1) mod 8 = 3 -> (5*3+1) mod 8 = 0 -> (5*0+1) mod 8 = 1 -> 6 -> 7 -> 4 -> 5 -> 2=

CPython changed this formula by adding =perturb= and =PERTURB_SHIFT= variables, where =perturb= is hash value and =PERTURB_SHIFT= is 5. By adding =PERTURB_SHIFT=, the probe sequence depends on every bit in the hash code, and the collision probability is decreased. And =perturb= will eventually becomes to 0, this ensures that all of the slots will be checked.

#+BEGIN_SRC 
j = (5*j) + 1 + perturb;
perturb >>= PERTURB_SHIFT;
j = j % 2**i
#+END_SRC

**** Dictionary improvement after 3.6
CPython 3.6 use a compact representation to save entries, and "The memory usage of the new dict() is between 20% and 25% smaller compared to Python 3.5".

***** Compact Hash Table
As mentioned before, entries saved in the form of =<hash,key,value>=. This will takes 3B on 64 bit machine. And no matter how much item is added into the dictionary, the memory usage is the same(3B*table_size).

After 3.6, CPython use two structure to save data. One is *index*, another is the *real data*.

For example, if the table size is 8, and there is an item in slot 1, the *index* looks like this:

=[null, 0, null, null, null, null, null, null]=

And the *real data* is:
#+BEGIN_SRC 
| hash | key  | value |
| xxx1 | yyy1 | zzz1  |
#+END_SRC

0 represents the items index on *real data*. If another item is added in slot 3, the new *index* become this:

=[null, 0, null, 1, null, null, null, null]=

The *real data* become this:
#+BEGIN_SRC 
| hash | key  | value |
| xxx1 | yyy1 | zzz1  |
| xxx2 | yyy2 | zzz2  |
#+END_SRC
This saves memory, especially when table load factor is low.

***** Order preserving
Since the index table records the order of items, so the entries order is preserved. This feature is now part of the language spec since Python 3.7.

*** DONE Circular Import in Python
CLOSED: [2019-03-10 Sun 10:59]
   :PROPERTIES:
   :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: circular-import-in-python
   :END:
Recently, I found a really good example code for Python circular import, and I'd like to record it here.

Here is the code:

#+BEGIN_SRC python3 -n
# X.py
def X1():
    return "x1"

from Y import Y2

def X2():
    return "x2"
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC python3 -n
# Y.py
def Y1():
    return "y1"

from X import X1

def Y2():
    return "y2"
#+END_SRC

Guess what will happen if you run =python X.py= and =python Y.py=?

Here is the answer, the first one outputs this:
#+BEGIN_SRC 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "X.py", line 4, in <module>
    from Y import Y2
  File "/Users/kk/Y.py", line 4, in <module>
    from X import X1
  File "/Users/kk/X.py", line 4, in <module>
    from Y import Y2
ImportError: cannot import name Y2
#+END_SRC
The second one runs normally.

If this is the same as you thought, you already know how python import works. You don't need to read this post.

**** Python import machinery
When Python imports a module for the first time, it create a new module object and set =sys.modules[module_name]=module object= , then executes execute in module object to define its content. If you import that module again, Python will just return the object save in =sys.modules=.

In =X.py= line 5, Python add =Y= into =sys.modules= and start execute code in =Y.py=. In =Y.xy= line5, it pause import Y, add =X= into =sys.modules=, and execute code =X.py=. Back to =X.py= line5, Python find =Y= in =sys.modules= and try to import Y2 in Y. But =Y2= is not yet defined, so the ImportError was raised.
**** How to fix
- Change import order.
- Wrap function call related to other module into =configure= function, call it manually.
- Dynamic import(use import within a function).

*** DONE C3 Linearization and Python MRO(Method Resolution Order)     :MRO:
CLOSED: [2020-03-14 Sat 17:37]
   :PROPERTIES:
   :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: c3-linearization-and-python-mro--method-resolution-order
   :END:

Python supports multiple inheritance, its class can be derived from more than one base classes. If the specified attribute or methods was not found in current class, how to decide the search sequence from superclasses? In simple scenario, we know left-to right, bottom to up. But when the inheritance hierarchy become complicated, it's not easy to answer by intuition.

For instance, what's search sequence of class M?

#+begin_src python
class X:pass
class Y: pass
class Z:pass
class A(X,Y):pass
class B(Y,Z):pass
class M(B,A,Z):pass
#+end_src

#+attr_html: :class image-size-s
[[file:/images/python_mro.png]]

The answer is: =M, B, A, X, Y, Z, object=

**** C3 Algorithm

How did Python generate this sequence? After Python 2.3, it use =C3 Linearization= algorithm.

C3 follows these two equation:

#+begin_src 
L[object] = [object]
L[C(B1…BN)] = [C] + merge(L[B1]…L[BN], [B1, … ,BN])
#+end_src
=L[C]= is the MRO of class C, it will evaluate to a list.

The key process is *merge*, it get a list and generate a list by this way:
1. First, check the first list's head element(=L[B1]=) as H.
2. If H is not in the tail of other list, output it, and remove it from all of the list, then go to step 1. Otherwise, check the next list's head as H, go to step 2. (tail means the rest of the list except the first element)
3. If *merge*'s list is empty, end algorithm. If list is not empty but not able to find element to output, raise error.

That seems complicated, I'll use the previous example again to explain the calculation of C3.

Let's begin with the easy ones. Firstly, calculate =A='s MRO:
#+begin_src 
L[A(X,Y)]=[A]+merge(L[X],L[Y],[X,Y])
         =[A]+merge([X,obj],[Y,obj],[X,Y])
         # X is not tail of other list, use it as H
         =[A,X]+merge([obj],[Y,obj],[Y])  
         # obj is in the tail of[Y.obj], use Y as H
         =[A,X,Y]+merge([obj],[obj]]
         =[A,X,Y,obj] 
#+end_src

=B='s MRO =[B,Y,Z,obj]= and =Z='s MRO =[z,obj]= can also be calculated.

Now we can get =M='s MRO:
#+begin_src 
L[M(B,A,Z)]=[M]+merge(L[B],L[A],L[Z],[B,A,Z])
         =[M]+merge([B,Y,Z,obj],[A,X,Y,obj],[Z,obj],[B,A,Z])
         =[M,B]+merge([Y,Z,obj],[A,X,Y,obj],[Z,obj],[A,Z])
         # Y is in the tail of [A,X,Y,obj], use A as H
         =[M,B,A]+merge([Y,Z,obj],[X,Y,obj],[Z,obj],[Z])
         # Y is in the tail of [X,Y,obj], use X as H
         =[M,B,A,X]+merge([Y,Z,obj],[Y,obj],[Z,obj],[Z])
         =[M,B,A,X,Y]+merge([Z,obj],[obj],[Z,obj],[Z])
         =[M,B,A,X,Y,Z]+merge([obj],[obj],[obj])
         =[M,B,A,X,Y,Z,obj]
#+end_src

**** MRO and super()

=super= also use C3 to find the inherited method to execute.

For instance, =C='s MRO is =C,A,B,Base,obj=, so after =enter A=, it will output =enter B= rather than =enter base=.
#+begin_src python3
class Base:
    def __init__(self):
        print('enter base')
        print('leave base')


class A(Base):
    def __init__(self):
        print('enter A')
        super(A, self).__init__()
        print('leave A')


class B(Base):
    def __init__(self):
        print('enter B')
        super(B, self).__init__()
        print('leave B')


class C(A, B):
    def __init__(self):
        print('enter C')
        super(C, self).__init__()
        print('leave C')

c = C()
#+end_src

#+begin_src
enter C
enter A
enter B
enter base
leave base
leave B
leave A
leave C
#+end_src

=super= works like this, it will get =inst='s MRO, find =cls='s index, return next class in MRO. (In python3, ~super(A,self)~ can be write as ~super()~)

#+begin_src python3
def super(cls, inst):
    mro = inst.__class__.mro()
    return mro[mro.index(cls) + 1]
#+end_src

When running this line ~super(C, self).__init__()~, self is =C='s instance, mro is:

#+begin_src 
[<class '__main__.C'>, <class '__main__.A'>, <class '__main__.B'>, <class '__main__.Base'>, <class 'object'>]
#+end_src

So it returns =A=, and A will execute ~__init__()~, then calling ~super(A, self).__init__()~, end enter =B='s ~__init__()~. (=C='s instance ~inst~ will pass as =self= in the calling chain.)

First zip all of the dependencies into zip file like this. Then you can use one of the following methods to import it.

#+begin_src 
|-- kk.zip
|   |-- kk.py
#+end_src
**** Using --py-files in spark-submit

When submit spark job, add =--py-files=kk.zip= parameter. =kk.zip= will be distributed with the main scrip file, and =kk.zip= will be inserted at the beginning of =PATH= environment variable.

Then you can use =import kk= in your main script file.

This utilize Python's zip import feature. For more information, check this link: [[https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/zipimport.html][zipimport]] 
 

**** Using addPyFile in main script

You can also upload zip file to hdfs, and using ~sc.addPyFile('hdfs://kk.zip')~ after =SparkContext= is initialized.

This has the same effect as =--py-files=, but your import statement must be after this line.

   :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: using-cibuildwheel-to-create-python-wheels
   :END:

Have you ever tried to install =MySQL-python=? It contains the C code and need to compile the code while install the package. You have to follow the steps in this articles: [[https://ruddra.com/install-mysqlclient-macos/][Install MySQL and MySQLClient(Python) in MacOS]]. Things get worse if you are using Windows. 

Luckily, as new distribution format *Wheel* has been published in [[https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0427/][PEP 427]].
#+begin_quote
The wheel binary package format frees installers from having to know about the build system, saves time by amortizing compile time over many installations, and removes the need to install a build system in the target environment.
#+end_quote

Installation of wheels does not require a compiler on system and is much faster.

[[https://github.com/joerick/cibuildwheel][Cibuildwheel]] is a very useful tool for building wheels. It can run on many CI server (GitHub Actions, Travis , Azure Pipelines etc) and build wheels across many platforms.

**** Usage

You need to create a configuration file for the CI server, you can read the [[https://github.com/joerick/cibuildwheel/tree/master/examples][examples]] and [[https://cibuildwheel.readthedocs.io/en/stable/options/][documents]].

For example, GitHub Actions can use this configuration file:

#+begin_src yml
name: Build

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build_wheels:
    name: Build wheels on ${{ matrix.os }}
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-18.04, windows-latest, macos-latest]

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        name: Install Python
        with:
          python-version: '3.7'

      - name: Install cibuildwheel
        run: |
          python -m pip install cibuildwheel==1.5.5
      - name: Install Visual C++ for Python 2.7
        if: runner.os == 'Windows'
        run: |
          choco install vcpython27 -f -y
      - name: Build wheels
        run: |
          python -m cibuildwheel --output-dir wheelhouse
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        with:
          path: ./wheelhouse/*.whl
#+end_src

**** Useful Options
These options can be applied by setting environment variables.

***** [[https://cibuildwheel.readthedocs.io/en/stable/options/#build-skip][CIBW_BUILD / CIBW_SKIP]]
Use this options to filter the Python versions to build.

Example:
#+begin_src
# Only build on Python 3.6
CIBW_BUILD: cp36-*

# Skip building on Python 2.7 on the Mac
CIBW_SKIP: cp27-macosx_x86_64

# Skip building on Python 3.8 on the Mac
CIBW_SKIP: cp38-macosx_x86_64
#+end_src

***** [[https://cibuildwheel.readthedocs.io/en/stable/options/#before-build][CIBW_BEFORE_BUILD]]
Execute the shell command before wheel building.


**** Upload to PyPI
Now you can download =wheelhouse.zip= from =Actions= panel on GitHub, and unzip it to dist folder. Then manually publish it by =rm -rf dist && python setup.py sdist && twine upload dist/*=. You can get more detailed guide from this article: [[https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/][Packaging Python Projects]].

This process can also be done automatically by using CI configuration file. You can find the example configuration files from [[https://github.com/joerick/cibuildwheel/blob/master/examples/][official repo]].

In Django 3.1, Django support save python data into database as JSON encoded data and it is also possible to make query based on field value in JSONField. The detailed usage can be found [[https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/db/queries/#querying-jsonfield][here]]. If you are using older version and want to try this feature. Though there are many packages ported this function, I recommend [[https://github.com/laymonage/django-jsonfield-backport][django-jsonfield-backport]].

**** django-jsonfield-backport
This package save data as JSON in database and also support JSON query. If your database meet the requirements (MySQL > 5.7, PG > 9.5, MariaDB > 10.2 or SQLite > 3.9 with [[https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/databases/#sqlite-json1][JSON1]] extension), you can use JSONField like Django's native implementation.

#+begin_src python3
from django.db import models
from django_jsonfield_backport.models import JSONField

class ContactInfo(models.Model):
    data = JSONField()

ContactInfo.objects.create(data={
    'name': 'John',
    'cities': ['London', 'Cambridge'],
    'pets': {'dogs': ['Rufus', 'Meg']},
})
ContactInfo.objects.filter(
    data__name='John',
    data__pets__has_key='dogs',
    data__cities__contains='London',
).delete()
#+end_src

**** jsonfield
[[https://github.com/rpkilby/jsonfield][jsonfield]] is another popular package to use JSONField. It will save data as =Text= in database, but you can manipulate field value as python data. In addition, it does not provide JSON querying capability as =django-jsonfield-backport=.

***** Django REST framework
As data is stored as JSON string in database, the output is string rather than object when Django DRF serialize =jsonfield.JSONField=. If you prefer to get and update the data like object, you need to manually specify it as `serializer.JSONField` like this:
#+begin_src python3
from rest_framework import serializers
from .models import Product

class ProductSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    images = serializers.JSONField()
    class Meta:
        model = Product
        fields = '__all__'
#+end_src

(You do not need to do this when using =django-jsonfield-backport=, everything just works.)

*** DONE How to disable auto strip in Charfield in Django          :Django:
CLOSED: [2021-12-19 Mon 21:20]
   :PROPERTIES:
   :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: how-to-disable-auto-strip-in-charfield-in-django
   :END:
In Django, when edit field in admin page or post data to forms, the leading and tailing whitespace in ~CharField~ and ~TextField~ are removed.

The reason is ~strip=True~ parameter in ~forms.CharField~, which is added in Djagno 1.9. You can see the discussion in [[https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/4960][django tiket #4960]] and here is [[https://github.com/django/django/blob/4ce59f602ed28320caf3035212cb4d1c5430da2b/django/forms/fields.py#L211][source code]]. ~models.CharField~ and ~models.TextField~ use ~formfield()~ to create form to interact with user, then both of them eventually create a ~forms.CharField~

It only affect the value return from forms, you can still update model manually and calling ~save()~ to save it with spaces.

Normally, this feature help us to keep text field clean. But sometimes you may want to get the original value, and here are three different solutions:

Suppose we have this ~Test~ model.

#+begin_src python3
# models.py
class Test(models.Model):
    char = models.CharField(max_length=20)
    text = models.TextField()
#+end_src

***** Change ModelAdmin
#+begin_src python3
# admin.py
TestAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    def formfield_for_dbfield(self, db_field, request, **kwargs):
        if db_field.name in ['char', 'text']:
            kwargs['strip'] = False
        return super().formfield_for_dbfield(db_field, request, **kwargs)
#+end_src
This method tackles the problem by overriding fields' default ~fromfiled~ method.

***** Define Custom Form
#+begin_src python3
# forms.py
class CustomForm(forms.ModelForm):
    char = forms.CharField(strip=False)
    text = forms.CharField(strip=False, widget=forms.Textarea)

    class Meta:
        model = Test
        exclude = []

# admin.py
TestAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    form = CustomForm
#+end_src
Now when edit data in admin panel, the whitespace is not removed anymore.

***** Use Custom Field
You can also use your custom field in ~models.py~. For example:
#+begin_src python3
# models.py
from django.db.models import TextField


class NonStrippingTextField(TextField):
    def formfield(self, **kwargs):
        kwargs['strip'] = False
        return super(NonStrippingTextField, self).formfield(**kwargs)

class Test(models.Model):
    text = NonStrippingTextField()
#+end_src

====

**** REST Framework
If you use Django REST framework to edit data, you only need to change the serializer.
#+begin_src python3
class TestSerializer(serializers.HyperlinkedModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Test
        fields = '__all__'
        extra_kwargs = {"char": {"trim_whitespace": False},
                        "text": {"trim_whitespace": False}}

*** DONE Memory Leak in Python multiprocessing.Pool
CLOSED: [2022-03-16 Wed 21:04]
   :PROPERTIES:
   :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: memory-leak-in-python-multiprocessing-dot-pool
   :END:

There is a historical memory leak problem in our Django app and I fixed it recently. As time goes by, the memory usage of app keeps growing and so does the CPU usage.

[[file:/images/pool_before.png]]

After some research, I figure out the cause. Some views does not close ~multiprocessing.Pool~ after using it. The problem disappears when I use ~Pool~ with ~with~ statement.

[[file:/images/pool_after.png]]

But I'm still interested in it and wrote some testing code. The script is run in Python 3.6.8 and produce similar result when using ~multiprocessing.ThreadPool~.
#+begin_src python3
import time
from multiprocessing import Pool


def func(i):
    return i


def ori():
    # create many thread as time goes by, when i==300 cpu grow to 300%, run out of 16g ram and stuck I have to kill process
    p = Pool(4)
    r.append(p.map(func, range(4)))


def with_close():
    # 100% cpu, 0.1 ram, create 40 thread, takes 41s
    p = Pool(4)
    r.append(p.map(func, range(4)))
    p.close()


def with_terminate():
    # 5% cpu, 0.1 ram, create 4 thread, takes 425s
    p = Pool(4)
    r.append(p.map(func, range(4)))
    p.terminate()


def with_with():
    # same as terminate
    with Pool(4) as p:
        r.append(p.map(func, range(4)))


r = []
s = time.time()
for i in range(4000):
    ori()
    # with_close()
    # with_terminate()
    # with_with()

    if i % 100 == 0:
        print(i)

print(f'takes {time.time() - s} seconds')
#+end_src

As you can see, there are four functions. The ~ori~ function is ~Pool~ with no ~close~ and ~terminate~, the RAM keeps growing and the script stuck. ~with_close~, ~with_terminate~ and ~with_with~ will exit normally but time is different.

**** Why ~close()~ is faster than ~terminate()~
~Pool.terminate()~ will call ~terminate()~ in each worker. ~Pool.close()~ just change the pool states and each worker will terminate itself. You can find the source code on [[https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.6.8/Lib/multiprocessing/pool.py][GitHub]].

**** Verify Memory Leak
#+begin_src python3
import gc
import time
import weakref


from multiprocessing import Pool

def func(i):
    return i


p = Pool(4)
wr = weakref.ref(p)
p.map(func, range(4))
print(wr())
print(gc.get_referents(wr()))
# p.close()
# p.terminate()
time.sleep(1)
del p
gc.collect()
print(wr())
print(gc.get_referents(wr()))
#+end_src

If not calling ~close~ or ~terminate~, after execution, ~p~ is still referred by some objects:

After calling ~close()~ or ~terminate()~, the last two lines become:
#+begin_src
None
[]
#+end_src

**** Document Update
The Python3.7 document adds this [[https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.pool.Pool][warning]]:
#+begin_quote
~multiprocessing.pool~ objects have internal resources that need to be properly managed (like any other resource) by using the pool as a context manager or by calling ~close()~ and ~terminate()~ manually. Failure to do this can lead to the process hanging on finalization.
Note that is not correct to rely on the garbage collector to destroy the pool as CPython does not assure that the finalizer of the pool will be called (see ~object.__del__()~ for more information).
#+end_quote

**** The Bug is Fixed in Python 3.8
In python 3.8.6, the script exits normally and the total execution time also decreases without calling ~close()~. I found this issue is fixed in Python bug tracker: [[https://bugs.python.org/issue34172][multiprocessing.Pool and ThreadPool leak resources after being deleted]].

*** DONE Python 3.11 changes
CLOSED: [2023-12-10 Sun 15:24]
   :PROPERTIES:
   :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: python-3-dot-11-changes
   :END:
In [[https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/pull/26923][[Packaging] Support Python 3.11 by bebound · Pull Request #26923 · Azure/azure-cli (github.com)]] , I bumped azure-cli to use Python 3.11. We've bump the dependency in other PRs, I thought it should be a small PR, but in the end, a lot of changes are made.

**** ~args.getargspec~
=getargspec= is dropped in 3.11. You can easily replaced it with [[https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html#inspect.getfullargspec][=getfullargspec=]] . It returns =FullArgSpec(args, varargs, varkw, defaults, kwonlyargs, kwonlydefaults, annotations)= instead of =ArgSpec(args, varargs, keywords, defaults)= So =args, _, kw, _ = inspect.getargspec(fn)= can be replaced by =args, _, kw, *_ = inspect.getfullargspec(fn)= However, =getfullargspec= is retained primarily for use in code that needs to maintain compatibility with the Python 2 =inspect= module API.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Note that [[https://docs.python.org/3.11/library/inspect.html#inspect.signature][=signature()=]] and [[https://docs.python.org/3.11/library/inspect.html#inspect-signature-object][Signature Object]] provide the recommended API for callable introspection, and support additional behaviours (like positional-only arguments) that are sometimes encountered in extension module APIs. This function is retained primarily for use in code that needs to maintain compatibility with the Python 2 =inspect= module API. --[[https://docs.python.org/3.11/library/inspect.html#inspect.getfullargspec][inspect --- Inspect live objects --- Python 3.11.4 documentation]]
#+END_QUOTE

The modern =signature= function provides the similar result but needs more modification:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  import inspect
  def testfunc(a, /, b=1, c=2, *args, kk, **kwargs):
      pass

  print(inspect.getfullargspec(testfunc))
  print(inspect.signature(testfunc).parameters)

  for i, j in inspect.signature(testfunc).parameters.items():
      print(i, type(i), j, type(j), j.kind)

  args, _, kw, *_ = inspect.getfullargspec(testfunc)
  print(args, kw)

  from inspect import Parameter

  parameters = inspect.signature(testfunc).parameters
  args = [k for k, v in parameters.items() if v.kind in {Parameter.POSITIONAL_OR_KEYWORD, Parameter.POSITIONAL_ONLY}]
  kw = next(iter([k for k, v in parameters.items() if v.kind == Parameter.VAR_KEYWORD]), None)
  print(args, kw)

**** Enum =__format__= change
There is some custom classes in azure-cli, which makes =Foo.BAR=='bar'=. In 3.11, the [[https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.11.html#enum][Enum]] =__format__()= changes, it returns the enum and member name (ex: =Color.RED=). (The =__str__= method is the same as Python 3.10)

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Changed [[https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html#enum.Enum.__format__][=Enum.__format__()=]] (the default for [[https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#format][=format()=]], [[https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format][=str.format()=]] and [[https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-f-string][f-string]]s) to always produce the same result as =Enum.__str__()=: for enums inheriting from [[https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html#enum.ReprEnum][=ReprEnum=]] it will be the member's value; for all other enums it will be the enum and member name (e.g. =Color.RED=). --[[https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.11.html#enum][What's New In Python 3.11]]
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  from enum import Enum
  class Foo(str, Enum):
      BAR = "bar"

  # Python 3.10
  f"{Foo.BAR}"  # > bar
  str(Foo.BAR)  # > Foo.BAR

  # Python 3.11
  f"{Foo.BAR}"  # > Foo.BAR
  str(Foo.BAR)  # > Foo.BAR
#+END_SRC

The standard way to replace Foo class is [[https://docs.python.org/3.11/library/enum.html#enum.StrEnum][StrEnum]]

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  class Foo(StrEnum):
      BAR = "bar"

  # Python 3.11
  f"{Foo.BAR}"  # > bar
#+END_SRC

If you also use =Bar(int, Enum)=, you can replace it with [[https://docs.python.org/3.11/library/enum.html#enum.ReprEnum][ReprEnum]]: =Bar(int, ReprEnum)=.

**** ~unittest.Mock~
The =unittest= module replace =unittest.mock._importer= with =pkgutil.resolve_name= in [[https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/18544][bpo-44686 replace unittest.mock._importer with pkgutil.resolve_name by graingert · Pull Request #18544 · python/cpython (github.com)]], which also introduces some changes.

Previously, it use =__import__= to import the patch target, which does not check the module name. But =pkgutil.resolve_name= will check name first, thus =mock.patch= fails if the target is not a valid Python module name. For example, this statement fails in 3.11:
#+BEGIN_SRC python
  @mock.patch('azure.cli.command_modules.vm.aaz.2020_09_01_hybrid.network.vnet.List', _mock_network_client_with_existing_vnet_location)
#+END_SRC

  as =2020_09_01_hybrid= is not a valid variable name in Python.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
                _NAME_PATTERN = re.compile(f'^(?P<pkg>{dotted_words})'
                                           f'(?P<cln>:(?P<obj>{dotted_words})?)?$',
                                           re.UNICODE)

            m = _NAME_PATTERN.match(name)
            if not m:
    >           raise ValueError(f'invalid format: {name!r}')
    E           ValueError: invalid format: 'azure.cli.command_modules.vm.aaz.2020_09_01_hybrid.network.vnet'
#+END_SRC

As a workaround, =mock.patch.object= works.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  vnet = import_module('azure.cli.command_modules.vm.aaz.2018_03_01_hybrid.network.vnet')
  with mock.patch.object(vnet, 'List', _mock_network_client_with_existing_vnet):
#+END_SRC

The ultimate solution is fix module name.

**** ~argparse.ArgumentError~
[[https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/18605][bpo-39716: Raise on conflicting subparser names. by anntzer · Pull Request #18605 · python/cpython (github.com)]] Raise an ArgumentError when the same subparser name is added twice.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  import argparse

  parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
  t = parser.add_subparsers()
  t.add_parser('a')
  t.add_parser('a')
#+END_SRC

The above code works on 3.10 but raises this error in 3.11:

#+BEGIN_SRC

*** DONE ~__import__~ in Python
CLOSED: [2024-04-07 Sun 15:58]
   :PROPERTIES:
   :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: import-in-python
   :END:
It's known that Python's ~import~ statement is implemented by ~__import__~ function. In general, if we want to import a module dynamically, we can use ~import_module~ function, which is a wrapper around ~__import__~.
#+begin_quote
The most important difference between these two functions is that import_module() returns the specified package or module (e.g. pkg.mod), while __import__() returns the top-level package or module (e.g. pkg). -- https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.import_module
#+end_quote

~import itertools~ and ~from requests import exceptions~ can be translated to:
#+begin_src python
import importlib

itertools = importlib.import_module('itertools')
exceptions = importlib.import_module('requests.exceptions')
#+end_src

**** ~__import__~

This is an advanced function that is not needed in everyday Python programming, unlike ~importlib.import_module()~.

Here is an example of how ~__import__~ is called:
#+begin_src python
  old_import = __import__

  def noisy_importer(name, globals=None, locals=None, fromlist=None, level=0):
      print(f'name: {name!r}')
      print(f'fromlist: {fromlist}')
      print(f'level: {level}')
      print('-' * 80)
      return old_import(name, locals, globals, fromlist, level)

  import builtins
  builtins.__import__ = noisy_importer

  print('import math')
  import math
  print('from math import sqrt')
  from math import sqrt

  >>>
  import math
  name: 'math'
  fromlist: None
  level: 0
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  from math import sqrt
  name: 'math'
  fromlist: ('sqrt',)
  level: 0
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#+end_src
As we mentioned earlier, the ~__import__~ returns the top level module.

For example, ~requests=__import('requests.exceptions',globals(),locals(),[],0)~. If you want to get the submodule ~exceptions~, you need to use ~getattr~: ~equests_exceptions=getattr(__import__('requests', globals(), locals(), [], 0), 'exceptions')~.

There is another tricky way to import the submodule: use a non-empty ~fromlist~: ~requests_exceptions = __import__('requests.exceptions', globals(), locals(), [None], 0)~.

Additionally, we can also set ~fromlist~ to specify the names of submodules that should be imported. The statement ~from spam.ham import eggs, sausage as saus~ can be translated to
#+begin_src python
_temp = __import__('spam.ham', globals(), locals(), ['eggs', 'sausage'], 0)
eggs = _temp.eggs
saus = _temp.sausage
#+end_src

**** Skip importing non-existing modules with ~__import__~
This a use case of the ~__import__~ function. Some packages are missing, but we want to make sure that the code does not crash when importing them.
#+begin_src python
import builtins
from unittest.mock import Mock
old_import = __import__

def skip_imports(name, globals=None, locals=None, fromlist=None, level=0):
    skip_list = {'urllib3', 'requests_oauthlib', 'cryptography'}
    if name in skip_list or any(name.startswith(f'{p}.') for p in skip_list):
        return Mock()
    else:
        return old_import(name, globals, locals, fromlist, level)

builtins.__import__ = skip_imports

#+end_src

*** DONE ~sys.path~ in Python
CLOSED: [2024-08-11 Sun 15:56]
   :PROPERTIES:
   :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: sys-dot-path-in-python
   :END:
Here is the process how ~sys.path~ is set in Python, with some parts omitted.
**** Python Command Line Arguments
By default, as initialized upon program startup, a potentially unsafe path is prepended to ~sys.path~:

~python -m~: prepend the current working directory.

~python script.py~: prepend the script’s directory. If it’s a symbolic link, resolve symbolic links.

~python -c~ and python (REPL): prepend an empty string, which means the current working directory.

You can remove these path with ~-P~ param.
**** ~PYTHONPATH~
If this environment variable is set, the folders in it will be added to ~sys.path~. The folders are separated by colons on Unix and semicolons on Windows.
**** ~prefix~ and ~exec_prefix~
These two variable define the standard Python modules and extension modules. Python has a specific path to search depends on the OS. The start point is Python executable path, which is called ~home~ (the symbolic links are followed).

Once ~home~ is determined, the ~prefix~ directory is found by looking for ~pythongmajorversionminorversion.zip~. For example, ~python312.zip~. On Windows, the zip package is in the same directory as the Python executable. On Unix, it is in ~/lib~ folder. If it is not found, on Windows, it will looks for ~Lib\os.py~. On Unix, it will look for ~lib/python3.12/os.py~.

On macOS, the ~home~ is ~/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.12/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.12/bin/python3.12~. The ~prefix~ is ~/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.12/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.12~, because ~lib/python3.12/os.py~ is there.

On Windows, the ~exec_prefix~ is the same as ~prefix~. But on other OS, ~exec_prefix~ is determined by ~lib/python3.xx/lib-dynload~. On my mac, it's still ~/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.12/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.12~.

~lib/python312.zip~, ~lib/python3.12~ and ~lib/python3.12/lib-dynload~ are added into ~sys.path~.

**** ~site~ module
This module is automatically called during Python startup, which tries to append the ~site-packages~ folder into ~sys.path~. It can be disabled with ~-S~ option.

Finding ~site-packages~ folder is easy. It can be guessed by ~prefix~ and ~exec_prefix~. These two path is head, and the tail part is ~lib/site-packages~ on Windows or ~lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages~ on *nix. For each of the head-tail combinations, it add the path into ~sys.path~ if it exists.

***** .pth files
If a ~name.pth~ file exits in the ~site-packages~ folder, its content are additional items to be added into ~sys.path~. Each line is a relative path.

The site module also tries to add ~USER_SITE~ folder into ~sys.path~. Default value is ~~/.local/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages~ for UNIX and non-framework macOS builds, ~~/Library/Python/X.Y/lib/python/site-packages~ for macOS framework builds, and ~%APPDATA%\Python\PythonXY\site-packages~ on Windows.

**** Example
We can use ~python3 -m site~ to quickly check ~sys.path~ and user site. Here is the output on my mac:
#+begin_src 
sys.path = [
    '{current folder}',
    '/opt/homebrew/Cellar/python@3.12/3.12.4/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.12/lib/python312.zip',
    '/opt/homebrew/Cellar/python@3.12/3.12.4/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.12/lib/python3.12',
    '/opt/homebrew/Cellar/python@3.12/3.12.4/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.12/lib/python3.12/lib-dynload',
    '/opt/homebrew/lib/python3.12/site-packages',
    '/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.12/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.12/lib/python3.12/site-packages',
]
USER_BASE: '/Users/kk/Library/Python/3.12' (doesn't exist)
USER_SITE: '/Users/kk/Library/Python/3.12/lib/python/site-packages' (doesn't exist)
ENABLE_USER_SITE: True
#+end_src
The path is slightly different from what the document states. The ~site-packages~ folder is not the same as ~prefix~. I guess that because Homebrew creates lots of symbol link. ~python3~ is ~/opt/homebrew/bin/python3~ -> ~opt/homebrew/Cellar/python@3.12/3.12.4/bin/python3~ -> ~/opt/homebrew/Cellar/python@3.12/3.12.4/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.12/bin/python3~.
#+begin_src 
>>> import sys
>>> sys.prefix
'/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.12/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.12'
>>> sys.exec_prefix
'/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.12/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.12'
#+end_src


Here is the output on my Ubuntu server:
#+begin_src 
sys.path = [
    '{current folder}',
    '/usr/lib/python38.zip',
    '/usr/lib/python3.8',
    '/usr/lib/python3.8/lib-dynload',
    '/home/kk/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages',
    '/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages',

]
USER_BASE: '/home/kk/.local' (exists)
USER_SITE: '/home/kk/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages' (exists)
ENABLE_USER_SITE: True
#+end_src

The doc also does not explain why `/opt/homebrew/lib/python3.12/site-packages` is in the path. This doc is somewhat out-of-date: https://discuss.python.org/t/the-document-on-pythonhome-might-be-wrong/19614

Nowadays, ~pyproject.toml~ becomes the standard configuration file for packaging. Compare with the old ~setup.py~, it adds two feature pep517 and pep518.

[[https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/][pep517]] defines two hooks: ~build_wheel~ and ~build_sdist~, which is required to build the package from source. Each build backend must implement these two hooks. It makes it possible to create other build backend such as ~flit~ or ~poetry~.
#+begin_src toml
[build-system]
# Defined by PEP 518:
requires = ["flit"]
# Defined by this PEP:
build-backend = "local_backend"
backend-path = ["backend"]
#+end_src
Besides ~setuptools~, there are some other build back-end such as ~hatchling~ and ~flit~. You can find the example here: [[https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/#choosing-a-build-backend][Python Packaging Uer Guide - Choosing a build backend]]

[[https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/][pep518]] defines the format of ~pyproject.toml~, where you can specify you build dependencies, ensuring the necessary tools will be installed when building project. For example:
#+begin_src toml

| python setup.py bdist_wheel | python -m build  |

[[https://build.pypa.io/en/stable/][Build]] is a pep 517 compatible build fontend, it calls build backend to generate the source and wheel distribution. It's the recommended way to build the package.

**** When ~--use-pep517~ is activated?

If the source distribution contains ~pyproject.toml~, ~pip~ will use ~pep517~ to build the package.

If the current env does not have ~setuptools`~ or ~wheel~, ~pip~ will use ~pep517~ to build the package: [[https://github.com/pypa/pip/blob/ec5faeac4ef6bae97df0e779566ceb2b0de89d3f/src/pip/_internal/pyproject.py#L107][pip source code]]

You can also force ~pip~ to use ~pep517~ with ~--use-pep517~, or disable it and use the legacy behavior with ~--no-use-pep517~.

**** What's the difference between ~--use-pep517~ and legacy behavior?

This is a typical log which uses ~--use-pep517~:
#+begin_src text
  root@427314aff523:/# pip install requests --no-binary :all: --no-deps
Collecting requests
  Using cached requests-2.32.3.tar.gz (131 kB)

#+end_src

This is the one which uses the legacy behavior:
#+begin_src text
  Processing d:\a\_work\1\s\src\azure-cli
  Preparing metadata (setup.py): started
  Preparing metadata (setup.py): finished with status 'done'
Building wheels for collected packages: azure-cli
  Building wheel for azure-cli (setup.py): started
  Building wheel for azure-cli (setup.py): finished with status 'done'
#+end_src

The main difference is that ~--use-pep517~ will create a temp build env and build the package in it. The build env is totally fresh, it has to install the build dependencies such as ~setuptools~ first, then call the backend to build the wheel pacakge. Finally, it will install the wheel package.

In legacy behavior, ~pip~ use the current env's ~pip~, ~setuptools~ and ~wheel~ to build the package with ~python setup.py bdist_wheel~, then install the wheel package.

**** A weird issue related to ~--use-pep517~
When bump Python 3.12 in Azure CLI, the ~get-pip.py~ does not install ~setuptools~ by default, as well as ~wheel~. So the ~pip~ tries to use ~pep517~ to build azure-cli.

However, the runner agent is using Python 3.12.6 and the embedded Python is 3.12.7. They have a compatibility issue. In the build env, the ~python -m pip~ fails with code 57005, because it tries to load modules in 3.12.6. I have to use ~python -Im pip~ to install the package. However, in the build env, the ~-I~ param is not honored, the command still fails. I've created an [[https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/13023][issue]] in pip repo. The workaround is so complicated, so I have to install ~setuptools~ and ~wheel~ to let ~pip~ use the legacy behavior, which use the env's ~pip~ to build the package.

The details can be found in the [[https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/pull/29887#discussion_r1802648918][PR]]

*** DONE Namespace Package in Python
CLOSED: [2025-08-10 Sun 18:04]
   :PROPERTIES:
   :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: namespace-package-in-python
   :END:
Recently, there is a [[https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues/31843#issuecomment-3125269740][GitHub issue]] about namespace package in Azure CLI. I think it is a good time to write down the knowledge about namespace package.

**** What is Namespace Package
If several packages share the same root folder, then the root folder is a namespace package. ~subpackageA~ and ~subpackageb~ can be installed separately, even in different Python path, but they can be imported as importing a single package: ~import root~.
**** How to create namespace Package
There are three ways to create namespace package in Python, you can find the details in [[https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/packaging-namespace-packages/][Packaging namespace packages]].

***** Native namespace packages
Don't need to create ~__init__.py~ in root folder, and use ~include = ["mynamespace.subpackage_a"]~ in ~pyproject.toml~.

After installation, the root folder does not contain ~__init__.py~, so Python treats it as an implicit because of [[https://peps.python.org/pep-0420/][PEP 420]].

***** Legacy method: pkgutil-style namespace packages
The only reason to use this method is to support Python2. You need to create this ~__init__.py~ in root folder:
#+begin_src python
  __path__ = __import__('pkgutil').extend_path(__path__, __name__)
#+end_src

After installation, the ~__init__.py~ is also kept in the root folder.

***** Legacy method: pkg_resource-style namespace packages
This method relies on ~setuptools~. After Python 3.12, ~setuptools~ is not installed by default, and now it's also deprecated in ~setuptools~. Currently, it shows this warning:
#+begin_src text
UserWarning: pkg_resources is deprecated as an API. See https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/pkg_resources.html. The pkg_resources package is slated for removal as early as 2025-11-30. Refrain from using this package or pin to Setuptools<81.
#+end_src
So I don't recommend using this method.

You need to create this ~__init__.py~ in root folder, and declare the namespace package in ~setup.py~: ~namespace_packages=['mynamespace']~.
#+begin_src python
__import__('pkg_resources').declare_namespace(__name__)
#+end_src
After installation, the ~__init__.py~ is not kept in the root folder.

If you forget to declare the namespace package in ~setup.py~, ~__init__.py~ is kept in the root folder, and the root folder become a normal package. You will get trouble if you install subpackages in different Python path.

**** Difference between these three styles

The main difference is whether there is a ~__init__.py~ in the root folder after installation. If there is, then it is a imported as regular package, otherwise it is a namespace package. ~pkgutil~ style will include a ~__init__.py~ in the root folder.

Another difference is that if it's a namespace package, then if you change the ~sys.path~, the namespace package will be updated. If it's a regular package, then it will not be updated. For example, if you update the ~sys.path~ and there is new subpackage in the added path, the namespace package will be updated to include the new subpackages. But if it's a regular package, it will not be updated, and you will get ~ModuleNotFoundError~ when you try to import the new subpackages.

I encountered this issue in the development of Azure CLI. ~azure-cli~ and ~azure-cli-core~ still use the ~pkgutls~ style namespace package. After installing them in editable mode, the extensions' ~azure-xxxx~ dependency fails to load. Because there is a ~__init__.py~ in source code, and ~azure~ folder is treated as a regular package. The extension dependencies are added to the ~sys.path~ after ~azure~ is imported so the new ~azure=xxx~ package is ignored. (Maybe deleting ~azure~ from ~sys.moudule~ and importing again can fix this but I haven't tried this.)

**** Mix use of different style namespace packages

You should avoid mixing different style namespace packages, but if you're working with legacy code, you may encounter this situation. (It get even worse that some packages' packaging is wrong. For example, they forget to declare the namespace package in ~setup.py~ in pkg_resource-style namespace packages, then the root folder becomes a normal package.)

Let's see the Python's import mechanism first:

#+begin_quote
If ~<directory>/foo/__init__.py~ is found, a regular package is If ~<directory>/foo/__init__.py~ is found, a regular package is imported and returned.

If not, but ~<directory>/foo.{py,pyc,so,pyd}~ is found, a module is imported and returned. The exact list of extension varies by platform and whether the -O flag is specified. The list here is representative.

If not, but ~<directory>/foo~ is found and is a directory, it is recorded and the scan continues with the next directory in the parent path.
Otherwise the scan continues with the next directory in the parent path.

--[[https://peps.python.org/pep-0420/#specification][PEP 420 Specification]]
#+end_quote

As you can see, if the ~__init__.py~ is found, the process stops and a regular package is imported. When you use the ~pkgutil~ style, it will also returns a normal package, even though it has tries to import the packages from all ~sys.path~.

For example, if you use the [[https://github.com/pypa/sample-namespace-packages][pypa sample-namespace-packages]] to test the namespace package. In the ~pkgutil~ style package, ~import example_pkg~ returns a regular package: ~<module 'example_pkg' from '/Users/kk/Developer/sample-namespace-packages/pkgutil/pkg_a/example_pkg/__init__.py'>~. In other two styles, it's a namespace package: ~<<module 'example_pkg' (namespace) from ['/Users/kk/Developer/sample-namespace-packages/native/pkg_a/example_pkg']>~.

So, it's okay to mix these three styles, as all subpackages should be imported. But if some invalid package (not following these three styles, only a normal package) is also installed, the import might be interrupted by the invalid package.

If you use the native style or pkg_resource style, Python only returns the normal package. The namespace package is ignored. That's why in the [[https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues/31843][#31843 issue]], the ~azure.cli~ is found.

If a normal package and the pkgutil style namespace package are installed, if the pkgutil package loads first, then all subpackages are imported. If the normal package loads first, then only the normal package will be returned.

In conclusion, if you want to use namespace package, then use the native styles and make sure each subpackages are packaged correctly. Otherwise, you may encounter some module not found error.

This post will tell you how to deploy it on your server.

**** Prerequisite
You need to install [[https://docs.docker.com/install/][Docker]] and [[https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/][Docker Compose]] before using =docker-compose.yml=

**** Install docker
Make a new =ttrss= folder, create =docker-compose.yml= with this content:
#+begin_src yaml
version: "3"
services:
  database.postgres:
    image: sameersbn/postgresql:latest
    container_name: postgres
    environment:
      - PG_PASSWORD=PWD # please change the password
      - DB_EXTENSION=pg_trgm
    volumes:
      - ~/postgres/data/:/var/lib/postgresql/ # persist postgres data to ~/postgres/data/ on the host
    ports:
      - 5433:5432
    restart: always

  service.rss:

#+end_src

Run this command to deploy: =docker-compose up -d=. After it finished, the TTRSS service is running on port =181=, the default account is =admin= with password =password=.

I made minor modification on the yml file, you can find the latest file [[https://github.com/HenryQW/Awesome-TTRSS][here]].

**** Nginx Configuration

If you have a domain and you can use Nginx as reverse proxy to redirect TTRSS to the domain.

#+begin_src 
upstream ttrssdev {
    server 127.0.0.1:181;
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name  RSS.com;
    return 301 https://RSS.com/$request_uri;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    gzip on;
    server_name  RSS.com;


    access_log /var/log/nginx/ttrssdev_access.log combined;
    error_log  /var/log/nginx/ttrssdev_error.log;

    location / {
        proxy_redirect off;
        proxy_pass http://ttrssdev;

        proxy_set_header  Host                $http_host;
        proxy_set_header  X-Real-IP           $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header  X-Forwarded-Ssl     on;
        proxy_set_header  X-Forwarded-For     $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header  X-Forwarded-Proto   $scheme;
        proxy_set_header  X-Frame-Options     SAMEORIGIN;

        client_max_body_size        100m;
        client_body_buffer_size     128k;

        proxy_buffers               4 32k;
        proxy_busy_buffers_size     64k;
        proxy_temp_file_write_size  64k;
    }
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/rss.fromkk.com/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/rss.fromkk.com/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot

}
#+end_src

To enable HTTPS on your website, you can use [[https://certbot.eff.org][certbot]].

**** Caddy Configuration
Update in 22/12/2021

I found Caddy2 is much easier to use than Nginx, all you need to do is add 3 lines in `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile`
#+begin_src
rss.com {
encode gzip zstd
reverse_proxy  127.0.0.1:181
}
#+end_src
Voila, a HTTPS enabled website is deployed.

**** Fever API and Mercury

- Fever
  1. Check =Enable API: Allows accessing this account through the API= in preference
  2. Enter a new password for fever in =Plugins - Fever Emulation=
- Mecury Fulltext Extraction
  1. Check =mecury-fulltext= plugin in =Preference - Plugins=
  2. Set Mercury Parser API address to =service.mercury:3000= in =Feeds - Mercury Fulltext settings=

**** Update
Simply run this command to update TTRSS code.
#+begin_src
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d
#+end_src

**** App recommendation
[[https://reederapp.com][Reeder 4]] works great on my iPad. It's smooth and fast, and is worth every penny.

If you want a free app, I suggest [[http://cocoacake.net/apps/fiery/][Fiery Feeds]]. I stopped using it after ver 2.2, as it's so lagging. If this issue was fixed, I thought it was the biggest competitor for Reeder 4.

   :PROPERTIES:
   :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: time-boundary-in-influxdb-group-by-time-statement
   :END:
These days I  use InfluxDB to save some time series data. I love these features it provides:
****** High Performance
According to to it's [[https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.7/guides/hardware_sizing/#single-node-or-cluster][hardware guide]], a single node will support more than 750k point write per second, 100 moderate queries per second and 10M series cardinality.

****** Continuous Queries
Simple aggregation can be done by InfluxDB's continuous queries.

****** Overwrite Duplicated Points
If you submit a new point with same measurements, tag set and timestamp, the new data will overwrite the old one.


**** Preset Time Boundary
InfluxDB is well documented, but the [[https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#basic-group-by-time-syntax][group by time]] section is not very clear. It says it will group data by ==preset time boundary=. But the example it use is too simple and doesn't explain it very well.

In the official example, when using =group by time(12m)==, the time boundary is =00:12=, =00:24=. When using =group by time(30m)=, the time boundary becomes =00:00=, =00:30=. It seems that the time boundary start from the nearest hour plus x times time interval, that's *not* correct. If you using =group by time(7m)=, the returned time boundary is *not* =00:07=, =00:14=

Here a example:

If the data is:
#+begin_src 
{'time': '2020-01-01T00:02:00Z', 'value': 10}
{'time': '2020-01-01T00:04:00Z', 'value': 8}
{'time': '2020-01-01T00:05:00Z', 'value': 21}
{'time': '2020-01-01T00:07:00Z', 'value': 33}
{'time': '2020-01-02T00:05:00Z', 'value': 9}
{'time': '2020-01-03T10:05:00Z', 'value': 4}
#+end_src

Execute ~select sum(value) from data where time>='2020-01-01 00:00:00' and time<'2020-01-04 00:00:00' group by time(7m) fill(none)~ will output: 

#+begin_src
{'time': '2019-12-31T23:58:00Z', 'sum': 18}
{'time': '2020-01-01T00:05:00Z', 'sum': 54}
{'time': '2020-01-02T00:00:00Z', 'sum': 9}
{'time': '2020-01-03T10:04:00Z', 'sum': 4}
#+end_src

Note that the time boundary begins at =12-31 23:58=, not =01-01 00:00=. What cause this?

InfluxDB using timestamp 0 (1970-01-01T00:00:00Z) as start time, and for each timestamp that is dividable by the group by interval, it create a boundary. So in this sql, the boundary should be timestamp 0, timestamp 420, timestamp 840 etc. =2019-12-31 23:58:00= convert to timestamp =1577836680=, it's dividable by =420=, so this is the nearest time boundary among the given data.

When you use =gourp by time(1w)=, you will also meet this problem: the result time begins with =Thursday= rather than =Monday=. As =1970-01-01= is Thursday.

So when you use =group by time= statement, you'd better use =30s=, =1m=, =5m=, =10m= as interval, which are factors of =1h=, so the result always begin at =xx:00=.

Some times you want to calculate the sum of last recent 5m data every minute, by using =group by time(5m)=, you only get 1 result every 5 minute. To achieve this, you can use the =offset= parameter in =group by time= statement. For example, =group by time(5m,1m)= with move the time boundary 1 minute forward, the result will be =xx:01=, =xx:06=. you can create 5 continuous queries with offset from 0 to 4.

More example can be found in this [[https://github.com/bebound/influx_time_boundary][repo]].

**** Group by in Continuous Queries
By reading the [[https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/continuous_queries/#advanced-syntax][official resample document]], the =resample every <interval> for <interval>= can override the continuous queries execute interval and the time range of query statement.

The example in official document the interval is always a multiple of =group by time(m)=. I tries different values, here is the result.

***** Every Interval

=every= interval can be any value regardless of =group by time= interval. The CQ will execute at the time boundary of =every= interval.

***** For Interval
=for= interval can be greater or equal to =group by time(xx)=. If it is less than group by interval, influx will raise an error like this: ~ERR: error parsing query: FOR duration must be >= GROUP BY time duration: must be a minimum of 20s, got 5s~

***** Start Time and End Time in CQs
Here is a simple example, =every 10 s for 45s group by time(20s)=

| execute time | selected start time | selected end time | real start time | real end time |
|     16:00:30 |            15:59:45 |          16:00:30 |        16:00:00 |      16:00:40 |
|     16:00:40 |            15:59:55 |          16:00:40 |        16:00:00 |      16:00:40 |
|     16:00:50 |            16:00:05 |          16:00:50 |        16:00:20 |      16:01:00 |
|     16:01:00 |            16:00:15 |          16:01:00 |        16:00:20 |      16:01:00 |

We can see that, the execute interval is always 10s, but the start time and end time in CQ not equals to =now()-45s=-=now()=. It still based on =group by time='s time boundary, but the start time must >= selected start time and end time is also >= selected end time.

[[file:/images/influx_time_boundary.png]]

Here is another example, =every 5s for 10s group by time(10s)=
| execute time | selected start time | selected end time | real start time | real end time |
|     16:00:00 |            15:59:50 |          16:00:00 |        16:59:50 |      16:00:00 |
|     16:00:05 |            15:59:55 |          16:00:05 |        16:00:00 |      16:00:10 |
|     16:00:10 |            16:00:00 |          16:00:10 |        16:00:00 |      16:00:10 |
|     16:00:15 |            16:00:05 |          16:00:15 |        16:00:10 |      16:00:20 |


I guess the reason why start time is always >= selected start time is to prevent pollute previous data. If the aggregated data is not enough, it will overwrite the correct data generated before. If there is not enough data in end time clause, it will be correct in the future.

*** DONE C-m, RET and Return Key in Emacs                           :Emacs:
CLOSED: [2020-04-11 Sat 21:23]
   :PROPERTIES:
   :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: c-m-ret-and-return-key-in-emacs
   :END:

I use Emacs to write blog. In the recent update, I found =M-RET= no longer behave as leader key in org mode, but behave as =org-meta-return=. And even more strange is that in other mode, it behave as leader key. And =M-RET= also works in terminal in org mode. In GUI, pressing =C-M-m= can trigger leader key.

SO I opened this [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/issues/13374][issue]], with the help of these friends, the issue has been fixed. Here is the cause of the bug.

In Emacs, =RET= is not a key in keyboard, it's a logical key). Emacs bind =RET= to =C-m= in source code. In terminal, =<Enter>= and =C-m= both send =<CR>= (ASCII 13) character, so =<Enter>= / =<Return>= key is equal to =RET=. In GUI, pressing =<Enter>= / =<Return>= key actually sends =<return>= to Emacs, and Emacs automatically translate =<return>= to =RET=.

[[file:/images/emacs.png]]

This can be proved: type =SPC h d k <Enter>= in spacemacs, it will output ~RET (translated from <return>) runs the command org-open-at-point, which is an
interactive compiled Lisp function in ‘org.el’.~

Pressing =C-m= or =<Enter>= key usually given the same result, but you can also bind these with two different command. Take =M-RET= as example. If only =<M-return>= is bind, the =M-RET= is unbinded. If only =M-RET= is binded, then =M-return= is implicitly also bind to same command as =M-RET=.

In org mode [[https://github.com/bzg/org-mode/blob/093e65ecc74767fb6452f5b9cf13abc4c2f44917/lisp/org-keys.el#L468-L469][scr]]:
#+begin_src elisp
(org-defkey org-mode-map (kbd "M-<return>") #'org-meta-return)
(org-defkey org-mode-map (kbd "M-RET") #'org-meta-return)
#+end_src

These two keys were binded to =org-meta-return=.

The unfixed Spacemacs configuration file binds =C-M-m= as =dotspacemacs-major-mode-emacs-leader-key=.

In GUI, the =<Enter>= key will send =<return>= to Emacs. Org mode has explicitly bind =M-<return>= to =org-meta-return=, so =org-meta-return= is triggered. In other mode, the =M-<return>= key binding is not defined, so =<return>= will translate to =RET=, then trigger leader key.

In the fixed version, =dotspacemacs-major-mode-emacs-leader-key= bind to =M-<return>= in GUI, and this override org mode's binding. Finally meta return becomes leader key again.

*** DONE Retrieve Large Dataset in Elasticsearch            :Elasticsearch:
CLOSED: [2020-06-21 Sun 20:33]
   :PROPERTIES:
   :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: retrieve-large-dataset-in-elasticsearch
   :END:
It's easy to get small dataset from Elasticsearch by using =size= and =from=. However, it's impossible to retrieve large dataset in the same way.

**** Deep Paging Problem
As we know it, Elasticsearch data is organised into indexes, which is a logical namespace, and the real data is stored into physical shards. Each shard is an instance of Lucene. There are two kind of shards, primary shards and replica shards. Replica shards is the copy of primary shards in case nodes or shards fail. By distributing documents in an index across multiple shards, and distributing those shards across multiple nodes, Elasticsearch can ensure redundancy and scalability. By default, Elasticsearch create *5* primary shards and one replica shard for each primary shards.

#+attr_html: :width 600
[[file:/images/elasticsearch_cluster.png]]

How to decide which shard should the document be distributed? By default, =shard = hashCode(doc._id) % primary_shards_number=. To make this stable, the number of primary shards cannot be change the index has been created.

Usually, the shards size should be 20GB to 40GB. The number of shards a node can hold is depending on the heap space. In general, 1GB heap space can hold 20 shards.

As data is store in different shards. If there are 5 shards, when doing this query:
#+begin_src 
GET /_search?size=10
#+end_src

Each shards will generate 10 search result, and send results to coordinate node. The coordinate node will sort 50 items, and result the first 10 result to user. However when query become this:

#+begin_src 
GET /_search?size=10&from=10000
#+end_src

Although we only need 10 items, each shards has to return the first 10010 result to coordinate node, and coordinate node has to sort 50050 items, this search cost lots of resource.

As deep paging is costly, Elasticsearch has restrict =from+size= less than =index.max-result-window=, the default value is =10000=.

**** Scroll

The =search= method has to retrieve and sort the result over and over again, because it does not know how to continue the search from previous position.

=scroll= is more efficient when retrieve large set of data.

For example:
#+begin_src 
POST /twitter/_search?scroll=1m
{
    "size": 100,
    "query": {
        "match" : {
            "title" : "elasticsearch"
        }
    }
}
#+end_src
and the returned result will contains a =_scroll_id=, which should be passed to the =scroll= API in order to retrieve the rest of data.
#+begin_src 
POST /_search/scroll 
{
    "scroll" : "1m", 
    "scroll_id" : "DXF1ZXJ5QW5kRmV0Y2gBAAAAAAAAAD4WYm9laVYtZndUQlNsdDcwakFMNjU1QQ==" 
}
#+end_src

=Scroll= return the matched result at the time of the initial search request, like a snapshot, and ignore the subsequent changes to the documents(index, update or delete). The =scroll=1m= is used to tell how long should Elasticsearch keep the context. If there no following requests using the returned =scroll_id=, the scroll context will expire.

PS: In fact, when dealing the initial search request, =scoll= will cache all the matched documents' id, then get the =size= document content in batches for each following requests.

***** Slice

It's also possible to split the scroll in multiple slices and consume them independently.

#+begin_src 
GET /twitter/_search?scroll=1m
{
    "slice": {
        "id": 0, 
        "max": 2 
    },
    "query": {
        "match" : {
            "title" : "elasticsearch"
        }
    }
}
GET /twitter/_search?scroll=1m
{
    "slice": {
        "id": 1,
        "max": 2
    },
    "query": {
        "match" : {
            "title" : "elasticsearch"
        }
    }
}
#+end_src

The above request contains split the slice into =2= parts by using =max:2= parameter. These union of two requests' data is equivalent to the result of a scroll query without slicing.


The slice of the document can be calculated by this formula: =slice(doc) = hash(doc._id) % max_slice=. This is quiet similar to the calculation of shards mentioned before. For example if slice is 4, and shards is 2. Then slices =0,2= are assigned to first shard and slices =1,3= are assigned to second shard.

When slices number is =n=, each matched documents use a =n= bitset to remember which slice it belongs to. So you should limit the number of sliced query you perform in parallel to avoid the memory explosion. 

Getting =hash(doc._id)= is expensive. You can also use another numeric =doc_value= field to do the slicing without hash function. For instance:

#+begin_src 
GET /twitter/_search?scroll=1m
{
    "slice": {
        "field": "date",
        "id": 0,
        "max": 10
    },
    "query": {
        "match" : {
            "title" : "elasticsearch"
        }
    }
}
#+end_src

#+begin_quote
Query performance is most efficient when the number of slices is equal to the number of shards in the index. If that number is large (e.g. 500), choose a lower number as too many slices will hurt performance. Setting slices higher than the number of shards generally does not improve efficiency and adds overhead.

from [[https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-reindex.html#docs-reindex-automatic-slice][Picking the number of slices]]
#+end_quote


**** Search After

Scroll is not suitable for real-time user requests. After Elasticsearch 5, =Search After= API is added. It's similar to scroll but provides a live cursor. It uses the results from the previous page to retrieve the next page.

To use search after, the query must be sorted, and the following query also contains =search_after=previous sort value=.

For example, if the initial query is this:

#+begin_src 
GET twitter/_search
{
    "size": 10,
    "query": {
        "match" : {
            "title" : "elasticsearch"
        }
    },
    "sort": [
        {"date": "asc"},
        {"tie_breaker_id": "asc"}      
    ]
}
#+end_src

Then you have to extract the sort value of the last document, and pass it to =search_after= to get the next page result.

#+begin_src 
GET twitter/_search
{
    "size": 10,
    "query": {
        "match" : {
            "title" : "elasticsearch"
        }
    },
    "search_after": [1463538857, "654323"],
    "sort": [
        {"date": "asc"},
        {"tie_breaker_id": "asc"}
    ]
}
#+end_src

*** DONE Timezone in JVM                                       :Java:Scala:
CLOSED: [2020-10-18 Sun 23:49]
   :PROPERTIES:

   :END:
I wrote a Scala code to get the current time. However, the output is different on the development server and docker.
#+begin_src scala
import java.util.Calendar

println(Calendar.getInstance().getTime)
#+end_src
On my development server, it outputs =Sun Oct 18 18:01:01 CST 2020=, but in docker, it print a UTC time. 

I guess it related to the timezone setting and do a research, here is the result.

**** How Did JVM Detect Timezone
All of the code can be found in this function: =private static synchronized TimeZone setDefaultZone()=

#+begin_src java
  String zoneID = AccessController.doPrivileged(new GetPropertyAction("user.timezone"));

  // if the time zone ID is not set (yet), perform the
  // platform to Java time zone ID mapping.
  if (zoneID == null || zoneID.isEmpty()) {
      String javaHome = AccessController.doPrivileged(
              new GetPropertyAction("java.home"));
      try {
          zoneID = getSystemTimeZoneID(javaHome);
          if (zoneID == null) {
              zoneID = GMT_ID;
          }
      } catch (NullPointerException e) {
          zoneID = GMT_ID;
      }
}
#+end_src

First, it will check whether JVM has =user.timezone= property. If not, it will call this native method =getSystemTimeZoneID=, it was implemented in [[https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-jdk9u-backup-03-sep-2018/blob/master/jdk/src/java.base/share/native/libjava/TimeZone.c][java.base/share/native/libjava/TimeZone.c]], and the main logic is in [[https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-jdk9u-backup-03-sep-2018/blob/17007f6a09f553801fd424d3c71382717975f66d/jdk/src/java.base/unix/native/libjava/TimeZone_md.c][java.base/unix/native/libjava/TimeZone_md.c]].

In =Timezone_md.c=, it will find timezone by following steps, it will return the timezone immediately once found.
1. Find =TZ= environment.
2. Read =/etc/timezone=.
3. Read =/etc/localtime=. If it is a soft link(ex: =/usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Shanghai=), return timezone by path. Otherwise, compare the content with all files in =/usr/share/zoneinfo=, if found, return timezone.
4. Return =GMT= as timezone.

**** How to Change Timezone
The available timezone in Linux can be listed by this command: =timedatectl list-timezones=
***** Add JVM param
You can add =-Duser.timezone=Asia/Shanghai= as JVM parameters.
***** Set TZ environment variable
Add =export TZ=Asia/Shanghai= in =.bashrc=.
***** Change =/etc/timezone=
Set its content to =Asia/Shanghai=
***** Change =/etc/localtime=
Link it to =/usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Shanghai=
***** Change timezone manually in Java Program
All of these methods should work
- Add this line before get time: =TimeZone.setDefault(TimeZone.getTimeZone("Asia/Shanghai"))=
- Set JVM property by code =System.setProperty("user.timezone", "Asia/Shanghai")=
- Set timezone manually in Calendar =Calendar.getInstance(TimeZone.getTimeZone("Asia/Shanghai"))=

Kafka is a high-performance and scalable messaging system. Sometimes when handling big data. The default configuration may limit the maximum performance. In this article, I'll explain how messages are generate and saved in Kafka, and how to improve performance by changing configuration.

**** Kafka Internals
***** How does Producer Send Messages?
In short, messages will assembled into batches (named =RecordBatch=) and send to broker.

The producer manages some internal queues, and each queue contains =RecordBatch= that will send to one broker. When calling =send= method, the producer will look into the internal queue and try to append this message to =RecordBatch= which is smaller than =batch.size= (default value is 16KB) or create new =RecordBatch=.

There is also a sender thread in producer which is responsible for turning =RecordBatch= into requests (~<broker node，List(ProducerBatch)>~) and send to broker.

***** how are Records Saved?
The details can be found from these two articles: [[https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#messageformat][Apache Kafka - Message Format]] and [[https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/A+Guide+To+The+Kafka+Protocol#:~:text=A%20message%20in%20kafka%20is,on%2Dthe%2Dwire%20format.&text=This%20byte%20holds%20metadata%20attributes%20about%20the%20message.][A Guide To The Kafka Protocol - Apache Kafka - Apache Software Foundation]].

Here are some important properties in =RecordBatch= are: =batch_lenth=, =compresstion_type=, =CRC=, =timestamp= and, of course, the =List(Record)=.

Each =Record= consists of =length=, =timestamp_delta=, =key(byte)=, =value(byte)= etc.

When look into the kafka topic data directory, you may find files like this:

#+begin_src 
00000000000000000000.log
00000000000000000000.index
00000000000000000000.timeindex
00000000000000000035.log
00000000000000000035.index
00000000000000000035.timeindex
#+end_src

Kafka saves each partition as segments. When new record comes, it append to the active segment. If the segment's size limit is reached, a new segment is created as becomes the active segment. Segments are named by the offset of its first record, so the segments' names are incremental.

Furthermore, the segment divided into three kinds of file: log file, index file and timeindex file.
- The =log= file contains the actual data
- The =index= file contains the record's relative offset and its physical position in the log file. This makes the look up complexity for specific offset record to =O(1)=.
- The =timeindex= file contains the record's relative offset and its timestamp.
  
***** How does Consumer pull messages?
Consumer keeps reading data from broker, and decompress data if necessary. It will put data into a internal queue and return the target number of records to client.

=max.poll.records= (default values is 500) means the maximum number of records returned in a single call to poll().

=fetch.min.bytes= (default value is 1) means the minimum amount of data the broker should return from a fetch request. If insufficient data is available, the server will wait up to =fetch.max.wait.ms= ms and accumulate the data before answering the request.

**** How to Improve Performance
***** Increase Socket Buffer
The default socket buffer value in Java client is too small for high-throughput environment.
=socket.receive.buffer.bytes= (default value is 64KB) and =send.buffer.bytes= (default value is 128KB) is the =SO_RCVBUFF= and =SO_SNDBUFF= for socket connections respectively. I recommend to set it to a bigger value or =-1= to use the OS default value.

***** batch.size, linger.ms and buffer.memory
As mentioned before, producer always send message as =RecordBatch=. Each batch should be smaller than =batch.size= (default value is 16KB). Increasing =batch.size= will not only reduce the TCP request to broker, but also lead to better compression ratio when compression is enabled.

=linger.ms= is used to  specific the wait time before sending =RecordBatch=, and it will effect the real size of =RecordBatch= indirectly. The producer groups together any records that arrive in between request transmissions into a single batched request. If the system load is low and the =RecordBatch= is not full, the producer sender will still send this batch once it has been waited for =linger.ms=. =linger.ms='s default value is 0, which means producer will send message as quick as possible(but the messaged arrived between two send requests will also be batched to =RecordBatch=). Increasing this value not only makes real batch size be close to =batch.size= and reducing the number of requests to be sent, but also increases the delay of messages.

The =buffer.memory= (default value is 32MB) controls the total amount of memory available to the producer for buffering. If records are sent faster than they can be transmitted to the server then this buffer space will be exhausted. When the buffer space is exhausted additional send calls will block.

***** Compression.type
As the throughput keep growing, bandwidth may become bottleneck. It's easy to tackle this by add =compresstion.type= param in producer. Once it is configured, the producer will compressed the =RecordBatch= before sending it to broker. If the records are texts, the compression ratio should be high and bandwidth usage will be significantly decreased.

There are two kind of =compresstion.type=, topic level and producer level.

If you set =compresstion.type= in producer, the producer will compress the records and send it to broker.

There is also a topic level =compresstion.type= configuration. When it is set, producer's compression type is not constrained. The broker will convert data sent from producer to target =compresstion.type=. =compresstion.type= can be set as =gzip=, =snappy=, =lz4=, =zstd=, =uncompressed=, and =producer=. The default value is =producer=, which means the broker will keep the original data send from the producer.

How to choose compression type? According to cloudflare's test result in [[https://blog.cloudflare.com/squeezing-the-firehose/][Squeezing the firehose: getting the most from Kafka compression]]:
| type   | CPU ration | Compression ratio |
| None   |         1x |                1x |
| Gzip   |     10.14x |             3.58x |
| Snappy |      1.61x |             2.35x |
| LZ4    |      2.51x |             1.81x |

=Gzip= has best compression ratio but take lots of CPU time. =Snappy= keeps a balance between the CPU time and space. The new compression type =zstd= added in Kafka 2.1 produce larger compression ratio than =Snappy= with the cost of a little more CPU time.

These are common configurations, you can find more from the official document contains such as =max.in.flight.requests.per.connection=.

*** DONE Dynamic Allocate Executors when Executing Jobs in Spark    :Spark:
CLOSED: [2021-07-18 Sun 16:52]
   :PROPERTIES:
   :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: dynamic-allocate-executors-when-executing-jobs-in-spark
   :END:
I wrote a Spark program to process logs. The number of logs always changes as time goes by. To ensure logs can be processed instantly, the number of executors is calculated by the maximum of logs per minutes. As a consequence, the CPU usage is low in executors. In order to decrease resource waste, I tried to find a way to schedule executors during the execution of program.


As shown below, the maximum number of logs per minutes can be a dozen times greater than the minimum number in one day.

[[file:/images/dynamic_log_number.png]]

If I can modify the executor number by size of data to proceed, the resource usage should increase.

**** Dynamic Allocation
Spark provide a similar configuration to control the number of executors. By enable =spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled=, spark will change number of running executors by task number automatically.

***** How does Dynamic Allocation Work?
****** Request Executors
As is known to all, the action operators(such as =count=, =collect=) create Spark job. Each job is divided into stages by shuffle operation, and each data partition in the stage will become independent jobs. When dynamic allocation is enabled, if there have been pending tasks for =spark.dynamicAllocation.schedulerBacklogTimeout= seconds, driver will request for more executors. If the pending task still exists, the executor request will be triggered every =spark.dynamicAllocation.sustainedSchedulerBacklogTimeou= seconds. Furthermore, the number of executors requested in each round increases exponentially from the previous round. For instance, an application will add 1 executor in the first round, and then 2, 4, 8 and so on executors in the subsequent rounds. The number of total running executor should not exceed =spark.dynamicAllocation.maxExecutors=.

When receiving the first executor request, driver ask cluster manager to create executor. After the new executor is created, driver checks if there are more request waiting to created and handle all of the pending request.

The reason to use this strategy to create executor is to avoid creating too many executor when payload just peak for a short time and make sure there are enough executor to be created in a period of time if the payload keeps high.

****** Release Executors
After the executor is idle for =spark.dynamicAllocation.executorIdleTimeout= seconds, it will be released. The one which contains cache data will not be removed. To prevent the executor which keeps the shuffle data from being removed, a additional spark service is needed before spark 3.0. From 3.0, the external shuffle service is not required if =spark.dynamicAllocation.shuffleTracking.enabled= is used.

Dynamic allocation is easy to used, but there are two disadvantage:

1. Slow scheduling. Creating executors is serial. If two or more executor is requested, driver will ask cluster manager to create executors for at least two times. This is an issue if pods creation takes time. In general, that is fine as the K8s 1.6 SLO is that 99% of pods should be created in 5s in a 5000 node cluster.
2. Hard to release executor if each task is short. The release is based on the idle time. If there are so many short task, the executor is not like to idle as tasks are assigned uniformly.

In our spark program, the task is short and data must be processed in 1 minutes. So dynamic allocation not suitable.
   
**** Manual Allocation
Luckily, spark also provide a way to control the number of executors manually. We can use =sc.requestExecutors= and =sc.killExecutors= to create and delete executors.

In order to use these two function, we have to know the number of running executors and their IDs.

*Number of Running Executors*

The Spark program's RAM usage can be obtained from =sc.getExecutorMemoryStatus=. It returns a dict list like this: =[Map(10.73.3.67:59136 -> (2101975449,2101612350))]=. The key is IP with port and value is a tuple contains the max RAM and available RAM. Please note that driver is also included in the return data.

*IDs of Running Executors*

IDs is required when calling =sc.killExecutors=. This can be found in [[https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/monitoring.html#rest-api][Spark REST API]]. The executors information such as ID, cores and tasks is record in =/applications/[app-id]/executors=.

With the help of =sc.requestExecutors=, we can create as many executors as we want in one request. But the pod create time is still too long. To eliminate the pod create request, I used these strategies:

1. The running executors is expected to finish job in 50s, fot the purpose of reversing some time for delayed tasks.
2. When the expected executor is close to current running executors, no executor is requests or released.
3. If there is backlog data, request more executors.

**** Result

After using manually allocation, the CPU usage grows a lot and reaches 40%. The cores used by Spark programs drop from 1700 to 800. Furthermore, the Spark program can scale automatically.

Today I tried to delete an inactive Internet account on system preference. It was deleted successfully but come back again after 20 seconds. This drives me nuts.

I tried these methods, but none of them works.

+ Boot in [[https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201262][safe mode]], delete account.
+ Delete record in ~ZACCOUNT~ table in ~~/Library/Accounts/Accounts4.sqlite~.
+ Delete related items in Keychain Access app.


Later, =RedHatDude='s answer gives me a clue, it looks like a iCloud sync problem. I tried to delete the account on my 3 MacBooks together. Thank goodness! It does not show up again.

#+begin_quote
I managed to fix this issue today. Here is what I did:

1. Turn off keychain sync on all of my Apple devices (in the iCloud preferences). This included 2 Macs, an iPad and iPhone.
2. On each device I removed the accounts I no longer wanted
3. Then I turned keychain sync back on

This worked and all of my old/duplicate accounts are now gone.

*** DONE QNAP TS-453Dmini Review                                      :NAS:
CLOSED: [2022-01-19 Wed 00:17]
   :PROPERTIES:
   :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: qnap-ts-453dmini-review
   :END:
My first NAS is Synology DS120j, which is ARM based entry level product. It's okay to use it for downloading and backup, but not power enough for running docker and virtual machine.

So I bought this NAS last month, and I'm satisfied with it. Here are the advantages and disadvantages.

**** Advantages
1. High performance.

  It is equipped with J4125 quad-core 2.0 GHz processor, 8G RAM, two 2.5G Ports and 4 bays. Here is the [[https://www.qnap.com/zh-cn/product/ts-453dmini/specs/hardware][spec]]. Although J4125 is not the fastest CPU in 2022(the newer model coming with N5105), it is still able to run several docker containers together, and I can even run Synology and Windows 10 inside build-in =Virtualization Station=.

2. Low Price.

  I bought is at 2050 Yuan (about $320). Synology has similar model DS920+, which is 70% more expensive.

3. [[https://www.qnap.com/solution/qtier/en/][Qtier]]

  A special feature only available on QNAP. It will automatically move hot and cold data between SSD and HDD to get higher performance. There is one noticeable change: this NAS is so quiet and you can hardly hear HDD running.

**** Disadvantages
1. No native HEIC Support

  This means you can't preview the photos imported from iPhone. You have to pay for $12 to buy [[https://www.qnap.com/en-in/software/cayin-mediasign-player][CAYIN MediaSign Player]] to fix this.

2. Slow Start and Shutdown

  I know it's rarely to restart NAS, but taking several minutes to restart is not acceptable. I hope QNAP engineers can improve this in the future.

**** Docker Images Recommendation
Here are some docker images I think is useful:

- ~johngong/qbittorrent~

A torrent client which can also download new file through RSS feed.

- ~p3terx/aria2-pro~

Everyone knows what is =aria2=.

- ~dreamacro/clash~

A rule based proxy client.

- ~jeessy/ddns-go~

A simple DDNS client.

- ~linuxserver/plex~

Plex is app which helps you to manage and browser your media library. It can grab the metadata of TV shows, movies and music from Internet. It's provide app in different platform so you can access your media from anywhere.

There is only one thing I think that needs to improve: playback speed is fixed, which is not convenient when watching animation.

You can also give [[https://emby.media][Emby]] or [[https://jellyfin.org][Jellyfin]] a shot.

- ~portainer/portainer-ce~

QNAP has build-in ~docker-compose~ command. You can use this Web app if you prefer GUI.

- ~vaultwarden/server~

I deploy this on my VPS instead of NAS as port 443 is forbidden on NAS. It's a alternative of [[https://1password.com][1Password]]. Although the app UI is not perfect, it has all the function required by a password manager. There is no official way to backup data, so I use =crontab= to run backup script to save data to Google Drive by [[https://rclone.org][Rclone]].

The backup script is quite simple, you need to link your Google Drive account as ~google~ in Rclone before using this.

#+begin_src bash
#!/bin/sh
pwd
echo backing up
rm bit.zip
zip -rq bit.zip ./data -x ./data/icon_cache/* ./data/bitwarden.log
rclone copy bit.zip google:/应用/vaultwarden

You can also install [[https://github.com/xcodebuild/fcitx-remote-for-osx][fcitx-remote for-osx]] and use ~cute-jumper/fcitx.el~ to do so. As ~homebrew~ no longer support some build options, you need to follow the install instructions in the GitHub repository to build ~fcitx~.

**** Mono Chinese Font
I use a 14pt English font and 16pt Chinese font, one Chinese character is the same width as two English characters. It can be set by adding this into Emacs configuration file.

#+begin_src elisp
  dotspacemacs-default-font '("Menlo"
                              :size 14.0
                              :weight normal
                              :width normal)

  ;; add into dotspacemacs/user-config()
  (dolist (charset '(kana han symbol cjk-misc bopomofo))
    (set-fontset-font (frame-parameter nil 'font)
                      charset (font-spec :family "PingFang SC"
                                          :size 16)))
#+end_src

If you enable the ~chinese~ layer in Spacemacs, it provides a more convenient function:
#+begin_src elisp
(spacemacs//set-monospaced-font   "Menlo" "PingFang SC" 14 16)
#+end_src

PS: [[https://github.com/casouri/valign][valign]] provides visual alignment for Org Mode and Markdown without changing fonts.

*** DONE How to copy files temporarily in Dockerfile           :dockerfile:

   :PROPERTIES:
   :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: how-to-copy-files-temporarily-in-dockerfile
   :END:
It's very common to copy a local file into the container when build docker image. In general, we use ~COPY~ command. But it creates a new layer and increase the final image size. If this is a temporal file and we don't want users waste their storage space, how can we remove it? Here are some approaches.

**** Download the File Dynamically
If the file can be download from URL or you can create a local HTTP server to share the file, you can download the file, use it and delete it in one ~RUN~ command. For example:
#+begin_src dockerfile
  RUN wget xxxx && unzip xxx && rm xxx
#+end_src

**** ~RUN --mount~ Command
You can also mount file when build image if your file can't be download from Internet or the file is secret. Use it to bind files or directories to the build container.

A bind mount is read-only by default, add ~rw~ parameter to make it writable. The changes during the build are discared after the build is complete.

The mounted folder are kept in the image, but the files are gone. Don't forget to delete the empty folder if you want to keep image clean.
***** Mount folder
#+begin_src dockerfile
  RUN --mount=type=bind,target=/target_dir/,source=./source_dir/,rw
#+end_src
***** Mount file
#+begin_src dockerfile
  RUN --mount=type=bind,target=/azure-cli.rpm,source=./docker/azure-cli.rpm tdnf install ca-certificates /azure-cli.rpm -y && tdnf clean all
#+end_src
**** ~--squash~ option in ~docker build~
You can also use ~--squash~ to reduce image size.
Once the build is complete, Docker creates a new image loading the diffs from each layer into a single new layer and references all the parent's layers. So the extra space created by ~COPY~ command can be freed by ~squash~.

*** DONE Line Ending in Git                                           :Git:
CLOSED: [2023-10-21 Sat 15:40]
   :PROPERTIES:
   :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: line-ending-in-git
   :END:
When working on a project with multiple developers, the line ending can be troublesome. This article will explain how to configure line ending in Git.
**** Basic configuration
The line ending on Windows is =CRLF=, on Linux is =LF=. To prevent the line ending issue, we can set =core.autocrlf= to =true= on Windows to let git convert =CRLF= to =LF= when commit, and convert =LF= to =CRLF= when checkout. It is automatically configured if you install git on Windows.

[[https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/configuring-git-to-handle-line-endings?platform=windows][Configuring Git to handle line endings - GitHub Docs]]

#+begin_src powershell
  # Configure Git to ensure line endings in files you checkout are correct for Windows.
  # For compatibility, line endings are converted to Unix style when you commit files.
  $ git config --global core.autocrlf true
#+end_src

**** Advanced configuration
You can also use =.gitattributes= to control the line ending in each repository. The =.gitattributes= file is a text file that tells Git how to handle files in the repository. You can specify the line ending of each file type in this file.

***** Auto convert line ending
With =* text=auto=, Git handles the files in whatever way it thinks is best. This is a good default option.

Use =*.c text= to explicitly declare a file as a text file, so this file is always normalized and converted to native line endings on checkout.

Use =*.png binary= to explicitly declare a file as binary, so Git does not convert it.  (=binray= is an alias for =-text -diff=)

***** Force conversion when checkout:
You can use =eol= to force conversion when checkout. The following config enforces bat files to be converted to =CRLF= when checkout even on Mac and Linux.

#+begin_src text
  * text=auto
  *.bat eol=crlf
#+end_src

This is the result of =git ls-files --eol= on Windows and Linux:

#+begin_src text
  git ls-files --eol src/azure-cli/az.bat
  i/lf    w/crlf  attr/text=auto eol=crlf src/azure-cli/az.bat
#+end_src

=i= means the index, =w= means the working tree, =attr= means the attribute used when checking out or committing.

You can set =eof= to =crlf= or =lf=. If it's not specified, the line ending will be determined by =core.autocrlf= or =core.eol=. If =text= is set but neither of those variables are set, then the default value is =crlf= on Windows and =lf= on Linux and Mac.

***** Refresh setting
If you change the =.gitattributes= file, you need to run the following command to refresh the working tree.

#+begin_src shell
  # Please commit the .gitattributes changes before run this command.
  git rm -rf --cached .
  git reset --hard HEAD
#+end_src

**** Extra
1. Line endings in tarball also follows the =.gitattributes=. It's identical to Git checkout on Linux machine.
2. The ~.gitattributes~ settings will only affect new commits. If you want to change the line ending of the files that already in the Git index after changing line ending settings, you can use =git add --renormalize .= to force Git to refresh all tracked files. For example, if the bat file has been add as ~crlf~ in Git index and then you set it as ~text~ in ~.gitattributes~. Running this command asks Git change it to ~lf~ in index.

The disk performance in WSL2 is poor, it takes a long time to run ~git status~ in a host's repo. Moreover, if you set a fancy shell prompt, it will take a long time to show the prompt. This article will introduce how to speed up Git in WSL2.

**** How to speed up Git Command
The performance of file system in WSL2 is poor, it takes a long time to run ~git status~ in a host's repo. The solution is to use ~git.exe~ in Windows folder. You can add this into your ~bashrc~:
#+begin_src bash
  function git() {
  if $(pwd -P | grep -q "^\/mnt\/c\/*"); then
    git.exe "$@"
  else
    command git "$@"
  fi
}
#+end_src

**** How to speed up Shell Prompt
If you have configured a fancy shell prompt, powerlevel10k for example, it will automatically get the git status when you enter a git repo. It will take a long time to show the prompt inside a host's repo. You can accelerate it with two methods.
The first one is disable git status in prompt. You may edit the ~.p10k.zsh~ file and comment the ~vcs~ prompt element. Therefor, it will not get git status when enter a git repo. However, you can't see the git status though you are in WSL repo.

The second way is to disable untracked file check. You can run this command to disable it:
#+begin_src bash
  # stop checking for unstaged and staged changes
  git config bash.showdirtystate false
  # stop checking for untracked files
  git config bash.showuntrackedfiles false
#+end_src
In this way, you can still see other git status such as branch name and staged files with a instant response.

***** Theme
There are many themes in rockbox. I prefer [[https://themes.rockbox.org/index.php?themeid=3133&target=ipodvideo][fresh os light]] and [[https://themes.rockbox.org/index.php?themeid=3407&target=ipodvideo][adwaitapod Simplified]]. They also provide the dark version.

***** Custom font
See https://d00k.net/wiki/rockbox_advanced/font_combining/

**** Replace SSD
The original HDD is small, slow and fragile comparing with SSD, you can replace it with a SSD.

***** Different Adapters
- CE to m2 adaptor (chip: JMB20330) and a 2242 m.2 SATA SSD (Recommended)

- CE to TF card adaptor (adaptor is expensive but longer battery life)

- CE/ZIF SSD (The product discontinued)

***** SSD Size
Not all iPod OS can support large SSD. It has the maximum track limit and SSD size limit in default OS. The track limitation stems from the RAM size, the large capacity model comes with more RAM and higher track threshold. For IPC 6th and 6.5th, if you release a SSD which is larger than 128G, iTunes only recognizes 128G. This is due to the LBA28 Limitation. Both Limitations can be eliminated by rockbox. If you want to stay in the original OS, I recommend you buying a 5.5th Gen 80GB or 7th Gen.

**** Replace battery
iPod comes with a [[https://www.ifixit.com/products/ipod-classic-thin-replacement-battery?pk_vid=fb5c5f8766d880f516955682907df708][580 mah]] or [[https://www.ifixit.com/products/ipod-classic-thick-replacement-battery?pk_vid=fb5c5f8766d880f516955683667df708][850 mah]] battery base on the thin or thick back cover of your iPod.

After replace the SSD, there is a bigger space for battery. You can replace a larger battery to get longer battery life. Here is the guide: [[https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/iPod+Classic+Battery+Replacement/561]].

Some seller even provide a 3000 mah battery, I'm not sure whether your iPod has enough space for it, please as the seller before buying it. Some said the 3000 mah battery is fake, it's actually a 1800 mah battery. Source: [[https://www.iflash.xyz/3rd-party-extended-battery-guide/][3rd party

*** DONE Run Synology in QNAP NAS with PVE                            :NAS:
CLOSED: [2025-06-29 Sun 20:53]

   :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: run-synology-in-qnap-nas-with-pve
   :END:
Three years ago, I bought a QNAP TS-453Dmini NAS. Although it has a slow WEB UI and slow restart, it still fits my needs as all of the applications I need are running in Docker.

Recently, I want to move some files from my Mac to NAS to save space. I need a application behave like Dropbox, which can show all the files in the NAS and only download the files I need. I have tried the QSync, but it does not have thumbnails for cloud image and it does not have icons to show the file status. I also tried the [[https://www.seafile.com/home/][Seafile]], it's a powerful application, which requires 4G RAM to run, and there is bug in the thumbnail. I used to have a Synology ARM NAS, the Synology Drive has all the features I need, so I want to run it on my QNAP NAS. After some research, I managed to run Synology and QNAP together on my NAS. Here is the guide.
**** Install PVE on QNAP
To run Synology on QNAP, the first step is to install PVE. I put the PVE iso to a [[https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html][Ventoy]] USB drive and reboot the NAS. When hearing the beep, press the ~DEL~ key immediately to enter the BIOS. Change the boot order to boot from the Ventoy and then install the PVE on the NAS. Remember to move the PVE disk to HDD bay 3 or 4, and the QNAP bios won't set the bay 1 or 2 as boot disk.

**** Install Synology on PVE
It's pretty easy to install Synology on PVE, there are many guides in the Internet. Thanks to the [[https://github.com/RROrg/rr][RR]] project, you can install Synology on any x86 hardware.

**** Install QNAP on PVE
I have one SSD and one HDD. The SSD is used for PVE and Synology, but I don't have another disk to move the data to Synology. So I still need to run QNAP on PVE. Although the QNAP is not as popular as Synology, there is still a way to run it on PVE. I just followed [[https://post.smzdm.com/p/adm3qxen/][this guide]] to install QNAP on PVE. To pass-through the HDD, just run ~ls -l /dev/disk/by-id/~ to show all device and ~qm set {qnap vm id} -sata0 /dev/disk/by-id/{hdd_id}`~ to pass-through the HDD to QNAP VM. When restart the QNAP VM, it will ask you whether to load the OS from HDD, reset OS (but keep the data) or init the OS.

However, when I choose load the OS, it reboot and back to the same screen. I guess it might be a compatibility issue. Reset OS may work. For me, I create a new disk for the QNAP VM an install the QNAP OS, then I pass-through the HDD to the QNAP VM. Then in the ~Storage and Snapshot~ app, under ~Storage-Disks/VJOBD~, on the right corner, click the ~More~ button and choose ~Recover~. I managed to recover the data in the HDD. After that, I can use the QNAP as usual.
**** Synology OS vs QNAP OS
After using Synology for a while, I found the Synology OS is more user-friendly than QNAP OS. The UI is more responsive and the applications are more polished. There are more community applications available for Synology, and the overall experience feels more integrated. The Synology OS is more optimized. For example, the Synology backend services uses much less CPU and RAM than QNAP. I will migrate all of my data to Synology in the future once I got a new HDD.
